## FAQ


### What makes a kitchen cabinet shaker style?

A shaker style kitchen cabinet gets its name from the traditional Shaker style of furniture, characterized by its simple, clean lines and minimal ornamentation. Shaker style cabinets have recessed panels with a "raised and fielded" design, where the center panel is slightly raised, and the surrounding areas are recessed. This gives the cabinet a distinctive, classic look that has remained popular over the years. 

The shaker style is favored for its versatility and timeless appeal. These cabinets can work well in both traditional and modern kitchens, making them a practical choice for many homeowners and interior designers. Shaker style cabinets are also offered in various wood species, finishes, and hardware options, allowing customers to customize their look and feel. 


### What types of materials are shaker style kitchen cabinets made of?

Shaker style kitchen cabinets are typically made from hardwoods, which provide strength, durability, and a natural, aesthetic appeal. Common hardwoods used for kitchen cabinets include oak, maple, cherry, birch, and walnut. Some manufacturers also offer particle board or medium-density fiberboard (MDF) cabinets as more budget-friendly options. These materials, as well as engineered woods such as plywood, are also utilized in shaker style cabinet production. 

Hardwood cabinets generally have a denser grain and are more resistant to wear and tear, making them a preferred choice for many homeowners. However, engineered and man-made materials may offer practical advantages like easier cleaning, fewer markings, and a more stable price over time. The ultimate choice of material depends on individual preferences and budget considerations. 


### What hardware options are available for shaker style kitchen cabinets?

Hardware is an essential component of shaker style cabinets, as it adds functionality, convenience, and visual appeal. Common hardware options for shaker style kitchen cabinets include: knobs, pulls, drawer and door slides, and hinges. These elements come in a wide range of styles, finishes, and materials, allowing customers to personalize their cabinets according to their taste and decor. 

When choosing hardware, it is essential to consider factors such as ease of use, durability, and aesthetic compatibility with the cabinet's design. Common hardware materials include metal, brass, and chrome. Many manufacturers offer matching hardware kits that can be purchased for cabinets, ensuring consistency throughout the kitchen. 


### Can shaker style kitchen cabinets be painted or stained, or is the wood color permanent?

Shaker style kitchen cabinets can be painted or stained in various wood colors. The choice between painting and staining depends on your desired finish, budget, and aesthetic preferences. Painting the cabinets allows for a more consistent and versatile look, while a stained finish can reveal the wood's natural grain and character. 

Most shaker style cabinets are constructed using solid wood panels, which can be painted or stained. Particleboard or MDF cabinets can also be painted, but may not have the same durability or aesthetic appeal as solid wood cabinets. When purchasing shaker style kitchen cabinets, customers should ask the manufacturer about the type of material used and whether they recommend painting, staining, or finishing the wood. 


### What is the standard depth of a shaker style kitchen cabinet?

The standard depth of a shaker style kitchen cabinet is typically 24 or 25 inches. This depth accommodates standard countertops, appliances, and storage needs for contemporary kitchens. However, there may be situations where a shallower or deeper depth is required, such as when using smaller appliances or wanting to maximize space. In these cases, some manufacturers offer cabinets that have depths ranging from 12 to 36 inches. 

It is essential to measure your existing kitchen space to determine the appropriate cabinet depth for your specific needs. Consider factors such as countertop depth, appliance size and placement, and user comfort when selecting the right depth for your shaker style kitchen cabinets. Manufacturers may offer custom cabinet depths upon request to further personalize your experience. 


### How do I maintain my shaker style kitchen cabinets?

To ensure the longevity and appearance of your shaker style kitchen cabinets, regular maintenance is necessary. Cleaning should be done on a weekly or biweekly basis, using a damp cloth or mild dishwashing soap for stubborn spots. Ensure to wipe away excess moisture promptly, as standing water can cause issues like warping or discoloration over time. 

Regular dusting and removal of crumbs or spills can help prevent damage or discoloration. It is also crucial to keep your cabinets free of heat and direct sunlight, as prolonged exposure can cause them to fade or warp. Periodic reconditioning and resealing may be necessary for cabinets finished with paint or lacquer. Consult the manufacturer's guidelines for specific maintenance recommendations and products to use.

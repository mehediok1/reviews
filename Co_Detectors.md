## Buyer's Guide

If you're in the market for a carbon monoxide (CO) detector, you're making a wise investment for your safety and the safety of your family. CO detectors can alert you to the presence of this odorless, colorless, and poisonous gas, which can be produced by malfunctioning heating systems, cars left running in the garage, or even barbecue grills. However, choosing the right CO detector can be a daunting task. To help you navigate the options, we've put together this comprehensive buyer's guide for CO detectors. 


### How many CO detectors do you need?

The number of CO detectors you need will depend on the size of your home or the number of rooms where you want coverage. At a minimum, it's recommended to have one CO detector on each floor of your home, as well as in any attached garages. If you have a larger home, you may need additional detectors to ensure adequate coverage for all occupants. 


### Digital vs. Analog CO Detectors

CO detectors come in both digital and analog models. Digital CO detectors are more sensitive and can detect lower levels of CO than analog models. They also usually have a digital display that shows the CO level. Analog CO detectors, on the other hand, use a dial to indicate the CO level, and they may not be as sensitive as digital models. However, analog CO detectors tend to be more budget-friendly. 


### Battery vs. Hardwired CO Detectors

CO detectors can be battery-powered or hardwired into your home's electrical system. Battery-powered CO detectors are more portable and easier to install, but they will require you to replace the batteries periodically. Hardwired CO detectors, on the other hand, are more convenient because they plug into your home's electrical system and have a backup battery for use during power outages. However, they can be more difficult to install and may require professional assistance. 


### Additional Features to Consider

When shopping for a CO detector, consider these additional features: low battery alerts, voice alerts, tamper alerts, and smart integration. Low battery alerts will notify you when the batteries need to be replaced. Voice alerts will announce the CO level and where the alarm is located. Tamper alerts will alert you if the CO detector has been tampered with or removed from the wall. Smart integration allows the CO detector to connect to your smart home system, which can provide remote monitoring and notifications. 


## FAQ


### Why are CO detectors important to have in homes and offices?

CO detectors are vital for ensuring the safety of occupants in homes and offices. They help detect carbon monoxide, which is a colorless, odorless, and deadly gas that can cause severe poisoning or even fatalities. CO detectors provide an early warning system, alerting people when CO levels become hazardous, allowing them to take appropriate action, and prevent exposure to dangerous levels of CO. 

By installing CO detectors, you can help prevent potential disasters and keep your loved ones and team members safe from the dangers of carbon monoxide exposure. It is essential to check and test the CO detectors regularly and replace the batteries and units as needed to ensure the smooth and reliable functioning of the detectors. 


### What are some of the best CO detectors available in the market?

Some of the best CO detectors on the market include the Nest Protect, Kidde i12020SCOB-1/B, First Alert CO600OB/I, and CO4015B. These detectors offer various features like voice alerts, seamless integration with smart home devices, and long-lasting batteries, providing reliable and convenient protection against CO hazards. It is essential to choose a CO detector that suits your specific needs and preferences. 

When selecting a CO detector, consider factors like battery life, alarm type, compatibility with smart home systems, and aesthetics. This will help you choose the best CO detector for your home or office to ensure optimal protection against CO hazards and to comply with building safety regulations and requirements. 


### How often should I test my CO detectors?

It is recommended to test your CO detectors once a week. Testing the devices regularly ensures that the alarms are functioning correctly and helps prevent false alarms. If you have a CO detector with an end-of-life-replacement feature, it will automatically alert you when the unit needs to be replaced. However, it is still a good idea to test it regularly for added safety and peace of mind. 

It is essential to replace the CO detector every 5-7 years, depending on the manufacturer's recommendations. Some CO detectors come with replaceable batteries, while others have sealed batteries that need to be replaced as a whole unit. Make sure to follow the manufacturer's guidelines and replace the unit or battery as required to maintain the efficiency of the CO detector. 


### What should I do if my CO detector sounds an alarm?

If your CO detector sounds an alarm, it is crucial to take immediate action. The alarm indicates the presence of dangerous levels of CO in the room. Open windows and doors for proper ventilation and evacuate the area immediately. Make sure to take everyone with you, including pets, and notify other occupants of the need to evacuate. 

If possible, switch off all appliances and electronics, as CO can be emitted by malfunctioning or inefficient heating systems or gas leaks. Once you have left the area, call the gas or utility company for help in resolving the issue. Do not re-enter the room until the CO levels have been reduced to a safe level and the gas company has confirmed that it is safe to do so. 


### Can I use CO detectors as a substitute for smoke detectors?

CO detectors are not designed to detect smoke or fires, and therefore should not be used as a substitute for smoke detectors. While CO detectors can help protect against poisoning caused by CO gas, smoke detectors are essential for warning occupants in case of a fire or smoke exposure. Both smoke and CO detectors are critical components of any safety system and should be installed separately to ensure the optimal protection of your home or office. 

If your smoke detector is already integrated with a CO detector, it will provide a comprehensive protection against CO hazards as well as smoke and fire alerts. However, having separate smoke and CO detectors is the best practice to ensure the utmost safety and early warning system in case of either threat. 


### How long can a person safely stay in a room with a CO detector that has sounded an alarm?

The exact amount of time a person can safely stay in a room with a CO detector that has sounded an alarm can vary depending on several factors, such as the severity of the CO leak and the ventilation of the room. CO poisoning symptoms typically begin to appear between 15 to 45 minutes of exposure to CO concentrations of 50 to 400 ppm. Inhaling high levels of CO can lead to severe poisoning or even fatalities. 

As a general guideline, if your CO detector alarms, evacuate the area immediately and call for professional help to mitigate the hazardous situation. Do not attempt to re-enter the room until the CO levels have been reduced to a safe limit and the gas company has confirmed that it is safe to do so. It is essential to always follow the safety guidelines provided by the manufacturer and local safety regulations to ensure the utmost protection against CO hazards.

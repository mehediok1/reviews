## Buyer's Guide

Woven wall art is a unique and attractive way to add texture and color to your home decor. Whether you're looking for something to brighten up a small space or create a focal point in a larger room, there are plenty of options available to suit your style and budget. In this buyer's guide, we'll explore the important features to consider when selecting woven wall art, as well as some general advice to help you make the best purchase for your needs. 


### Material

One of the most important factors to consider when buying woven wall art is the material used. Common materials include raffia, palm leaves, jute, and rayon. Each material has its own unique characteristics, such as durability, texture, and colorfastness. Raffia and palm leaves can add a natural, tropical feel to your space, while jute and rayon provide a more modern aesthetic. Consider the environment in which the wall art will be placed, as well as your personal preferences, when choosing the material. 


### Size

The size of the woven wall art is another important consideration. Consider the space where the wall art will be hung and the amount of focal attention it will receive. Larger pieces can make a statement and draw the eye, while smaller pieces can add visual interest without overwhelming the space. Be sure to measure the available wall space to ensure that the size of the wall art is appropriate. 


### Design

The design of the woven wall art can have a significant impact on the overall look of your space. Consider the style of your home decor and choose a design that complements or contrasts with it. Patterns, colors, and shapes can all contribute to the overall aesthetic of the piece. Additionally, consider the frame or backing material, as this can add an extra layer of design and visual interest to your wall art. 


### Maintenance

Proper maintenance is essential to ensure that your woven wall art lasts as long as possible. Most woven wall art can be spot-cleaned with a damp cloth, but be sure to read the care instructions provided by the manufacturer to avoid damaging the piece. Additionally, consider the environmental factors in the room where the wall art will be placed, such as humidity and sunlight exposure, as these can affect the durability and colorfastness of the piece.

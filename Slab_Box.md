## FAQ


### What is a Slab Box?

A Slab Box is a type of storage box specifically designed for sliding under a bed or couch for easy storage and organization of items. Its unique slab-like shape allows it to slide easily without taking up extra space. These boxes are typically made of sturdy materials, including wood, metal, or plastic, and offer a simple yet effective solution for organizing your belongings. 

Slab Boxes are particularly popular for those living in small apartments, dorm rooms, or simply for those who want to maximize their storage space. They can be used to store clothing, shoes, bedding, books, and other miscellaneous items that you want to keep hidden from sight but still easily accessible. 


### What are the benefits of using a Slab Box?

Using a Slab Box offers several benefits, including increased storage space and improved organization. By sliding under your bed or couch, these boxes help to declutter your living space and keep your items out of sight. They can also be an ideal solution for those with limited floor space, particularly in small apartments or dorm rooms. 

One of the most significant benefits of using a Slab Box is its ability to store a variety of items securely. These boxes are designed with durability in mind, making them suitable for storing clothing, shoes, bedding, books, and other everyday items. They also provide easy access to your belongings, without the need to bend or move heavy furniture. Many users find the convenience of having a Slab Box to be a game-changer in maintaining an organized living space. 


### What materials are Slab Boxes made of?

Slab Boxes can be made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, or plastic. These boxes are designed to be durable and long-lasting. Wooden Slab Boxes are often the most popular choice due to their natural look and feel. They can be finished in a variety of ways, including paint or stain, to match the décor of your living space. 

Metal Slab Boxes offer a sleek and modern appearance, and are often preferred by those who want a more industrial look. They are typically lighter in weight and easier to slide than their wooden counterparts, making them a great choice for those who might have difficulty moving heavy boxes. Plastic Slab Boxes are typically the most budget-friendly option, and are lightweight and easy to move. They are a good choice for those who want a durable and waterproof storage solution. 


### How many sizes do Slab Boxes come in?

Slab Boxes come in a variety of sizes, often measured in inches. Some common sizes include: 12"x12", 12"x15", 14"x14", 15"x15", and 18"x18". The size you choose will depend on the amount of storage space you need and the dimensions of the area where you plan to store the Slab Box. Many manufacturers offer custom and made-to-order sizes as well, so be sure to check if you need a specific size not listed above. 

It's essential to select the right size for your needs. Choosing a box that's too small may result in wasted space, while choosing one that's too large may make it difficult to slide under your bed or couch. Most manufacturers offer detailed product specifications and dimensions on their website, so it's a good idea to consult these before making your purchase. 


### What is the weight capacity of a Slab Box?

The weight capacity of a Slab Box will vary depending on the size and construction materials. Generally, Slab Boxes have a weight capacity of around 25-50 pounds, which is suitable for storing most household items. However, it's essential to check the manufacturer's product specifications for the exact weight capacity of the box you're considering. 

If you plan to store heavier items, such as books or electronics, it's a good idea to choose a box with a higher weight capacity or consider investing in a stronger material, such as metal or high-quality plastic. This will help to ensure the durability and longevity of your Slab Box, and prevent it from collapsing under the weight of your belongings. 


### Are there any special care instructions for Slab Boxes?

Like any other storage solution, it's essential to take proper care of your Slab Box to ensure its longevity. If you've invested in a wooden box, it's crucial to keep it in a dry area and avoid exposure to moisture or extreme temperatures. This will help to prevent warping or other damage to the wood. 

It's also important to consider the weight and dimensions of the items you plan to store. Slab Boxes are designed to slide under furniture, so it's essential to ensure that the items you store are not too heavy or bulky to make it difficult to move the box. If you plan to store items that have sharp edges, such as shoes or tools, it's a good idea to line the bottom of the box with a protective layer, such as bubble wrap or a piece of old carpet, to prevent scratches or damage to the box.

## FAQ


### What are portion cups and why are they important?

Portion cups are small, standardized measuring containers used for portioning and serving food. They are essential for maintaining a consistent serving size, which is crucial for both maintaining a healthy diet and ensuring that guests are served the same amount of food.

For instance, glass cups are durable, dishwasher-safe, and easy to clean, while plastic cups are lightweight and generally more cost-effective. 

Stainless steel cups offer excellent durability, are easy to clean, and are resistant to temperature changes.

Portion cups come in various sizes to accommodate different portion sizes or dish types. Common sizes include 1 cup, 2 cups, 4 cups, and 8 cups. Some manufacturers also offer customized or specialty portion cups in unique shapes designed for specific purposes, such as measuring coffee grounds or portioning out ice cubes. 

It is essential to choose the correct size of portion cups based on the specific dish or item you want to portion or serve. For instance, use a 4-cup portion cup for portioning out soup or salad, while a 1-cup portion cup is suitable for portioning out cereal or granola, and an 8-cup portion cup can be used for portioning out larger quantities of food, such as potato chips, nuts, or candy. 


### Can portion cups be used for both cooking and serving purposes?

Yes, portion cups can be used for both cooking and serving purposes. They are versatile tools that can help with meal planning, portioning, and food portion control in and out of the kitchen. Most portion cups are microwave-safe and can be used for reheating or defrosting food in the microwave. Some portion cups are designed to be used in the oven or toaster, making them a convenient option for oven heating or toasting purposes.

### How can I ensure that my portion cups last for a long time?

To ensure that your portion cups last for a long time, handle them with care when washing and drying. Glass and stainless steel portion cups should not be exposed to extreme temperatures, which can cause them to crack or break. Keep them away from sharp objects or surfaces to prevent damage or injury. Storing your portion cups in a dry and cool place can also help prolong their lifespan. 

When using your portion cups, avoid overfilling them, as this can put additional stress on the material and potentially lead to cracks or breakage. Regularly inspect your portion cups for any signs of wear and tear, such as chipping or cracking, and replace them as soon as possible. By taking proper care of your portion cups, you can ensure they continue to serve you well for years to come.

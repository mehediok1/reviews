In this buyer's guide, we will discuss the essential features to consider when selecting a record console, general advice for maintaining it, and several considerations to ensure you make the best purchase. 


### Size and Design

The size and design of the record console are critical factors to consider. Firstly, determine the available space in your room to find a console that fits comfortably.

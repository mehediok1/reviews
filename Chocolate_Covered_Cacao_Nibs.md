## FAQ


### What are cacao nibs?

Cacao nibs are tiny fragments of cacao beans that have been removed from the cacao pod, dried, roasted, and then broken into pieces. They have a bitter and slightly sweet taste with a crunchy texture. Cacao nibs are considered a superfood due to their high content of antioxidants, magnesium, and other essential nutrients. 

Some people enjoy munching on them straight from the package, while others use them as an ingredient in various recipes like trail mixes, smoothies, and even chocolate bars. Chocolate covered cacao nibs are a popular choice for those who want to enjoy the health benefits and rich chocolate flavor combined. 


### What are the health benefits of cacao nibs?

Cacao nibs come packed with numerous health benefits due to their nutrient-rich content. They are high in antioxidants, particularly flavonoids, which help protect against cellular damage and support heart health. Cacao nibs are also rich in magnesium, an essential mineral that aids in muscle and nerve function, regulates blood sugar levels, and supports bone health. 

Additionally, cacao nibs contain fiber, iron, and various other minerals such as potassium, copper, and manganese, which contribute to overall well-being. Consuming cacao nibs in moderation can be a great addition to a healthy diet for its numerous nutritional benefits and potential health advantages. 


### What are the benefits of chocolate covered cacao nibs?

Chocolate covered cacao nibs offer several advantages compared to nibs consumed plain. Firstly, the chocolate coating adds a sweet and indulgent touch to the bitter taste of cacao nibs, making them more appealing and enjoyable to a wider audience. This combination creates a unique and delicious flavor profile. 

Secondly, the chocolate coating may help enhance the bioavailability of some of the nutrients found in cacao nibs, such as flavonoids. This improvement in nutrient absorption can further enhance the overall health benefits associated with cacao nib consumption. Overall, chocolate covered cacao nibs can provide both a tasty treat and various health benefits for those who enjoy them. 


### What is the best way to store chocolate covered cacao nibs?

To maintain the freshness and quality of chocolate covered cacao nibs, it is essential to store them properly. Keep them in an airtight container at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. If you prefer to store them in the refrigerator, ensure the container is airtight to prevent the nibs from absorbing moisture. 

Additionally, if you notice any signs of the chocolate coating becoming soft or melting, make sure to store the container in a cool, dry place or refrigerate it. Proper storage will help extend the shelf life of chocolate covered cacao nibs and ensure they remain fresh and enjoyable to eat for a longer period. 


### What are some recipes where chocolate covered cacao nibs can be used?

Chocolate covered cacao nibs can be used in a variety of recipes to add a crunchy texture and rich chocolate flavor.

### Are there any precautions or warnings associated with consuming cacao nibs?

While cacao nibs are considered a superfood and offer numerous health benefits, it is essential to consume them in moderation. Cacao nibs contain a small amount of caffeine and theobromine, which can be too much for some individuals, especially children and pregnant or breastfeeding women. Excessive consumption of these compounds may lead to adverse effects such as increased heart rate, anxiety, and sleeplessness. 

It is also crucial to ensure that cacao nibs are of high quality and sourced from reputable suppliers. Some cheaper versions of cacao nibs may contain added sugars, artificial preservatives, or contaminants. Always look for organic, fair trade, and sustainably sourced cacao nibs to ensure you are consuming a high-quality product with the least potential for harm.

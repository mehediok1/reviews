## FAQ


### What is a Wired Camera System and how does it work?

A Wired Camera System, also known as a CCTV (Closed Circuit Television) system, is a type of security camera system that transmits video signals over a wired network. It consists of the camera, a digital video recorder (DVR), and monitors. The cameras are connected to the DVR using coaxial cable or Cat5e/6 cable, and the DVR stores the recorded footage. The system can be controlled remotely using a mobile app or a web interface. The cameras capture and transmit images or videos to the DVR, which then records and stores them for later playback. 

The cameras are equipped with a lens and a sensor that detects light and converts it into an electrical signal. This signal is then transmitted to the DVR, which decodes it into an image or video. The DVR can also be connected to the internet, allowing users to access live footage and recordings remotely using mobile devices or computers. 


### What are the benefits of using a Wired Camera System?

Wired Camera Systems offer several benefits over wireless systems. One of the main advantages is the reliability of the system. Since the cameras are hardwired to the DVR, there is no risk of signal loss or interference. This ensures that the system will always be operational and provide a clear, uninterrupted image or video. Additionally, wired systems tend to have a longer lifespan than wireless systems because they are not affected by signal degradation over distance. 

Wired systems also offer better security features than wireless systems. Since the cameras are hardwired to the DVR, it is more difficult for unauthorized individuals to tamper with the system. Additionally, wired systems are less susceptible to hacking and other cyber attacks because they are not reliant on wireless networks. 


### What are the different types of Wired Camera Systems?

There are several types of Wired Camera Systems, each with its own unique features and benefits. Some of the most common types include: Analog HD-SDI, IP (Internet Protocol), and HD-SDI. Analog HD-SDI cameras transmit video signals over coaxial cable, while IP cameras transmit signals over Ethernet cable. HD-SDI cameras use a single coaxial cable to transmit both video and audio signals. 

Each type of wired camera system has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, Analog HD-SDI cameras tend to be more affordable and have a longer lifespan than IP cameras. However, IP cameras offer better image quality and can be accessed remotely using mobile devices or computers. HD-SDI cameras offer the benefits of both Analog HD-SDI and IP cameras, but tend to be more expensive. 


### What are the key features to look for in a Wired Camera System?

When choosing a Wired Camera System, there are several key features to consider. These include: resolution, field of view (FOV), night vision capabilities, and weatherproofing. Resolution refers to the clarity of the image or video captured by the camera. A higher resolution means better image quality. FOV refers to the angle of view captured by the camera. A wider FOV allows for more coverage, while a narrower FOV provides a clearer image. Night vision capabilities are important for cameras installed in low-light environments, while weatherproofing is necessary for cameras installed in outdoor environments. 

Other important features to look for include motion detection, audio capabilities, and remote access. Motion detection allows the camera to only record footage when motion is detected, reducing the amount of storage space needed and making it easier to review recorded footage. Audio capabilities can add an extra layer of security, allowing users to listen in and communicate with individuals in the camera's field of view. Remote access allows users to access live footage and recorded footage using mobile devices or computers. 


### How do I install a Wired Camera System?

Installing a Wired Camera System can be a DIY project, but it is recommended to hire a professional if you are not experienced with electrical work. The first step is to choose a location for the cameras and the DVR. This should be a location that is secure and has a clear view of the area you want to monitor. The cameras should be mounted securely using a bracket or an adhesive. 

Next, connect the cameras to the DVR using coaxial cable or Cat5e/6 cable. The cables should be run through the walls or ceilings to the location of the DVR. Once the cameras are connected, the DVR should be configured to record footage and access the cameras remotely. This can be done using a mobile app or a web interface. It is also recommended to test the system regularly to ensure that it is functioning properly and to make necessary adjustments. 


### What is the difference between a Wired Camera System and a Wireless Camera System?

The main differences between a Wired Camera System and a Wireless Camera System are the way they transmit signals and the reliability of the signal. Wired Camera Systems transmit signals over a wired network, while Wireless Camera Systems transmit signals over a wireless network. This means that Wired Camera Systems are less susceptible to signal interference and loss, providing a clearer image or video. However, Wireless Camera Systems offer the convenience of being able to be installed in areas where wired networks are not available and are easier to set up. 

Another difference is the security features. Wired Camera Systems are less susceptible to hacking and other cyber attacks because they are not reliant on wireless networks. However, Wireless Camera Systems offer remote access features which can be useful for monitoring your property from a distance. Ultimately, the choice between a Wired Camera System and a Wireless Camera System depends on your specific needs and preferences.

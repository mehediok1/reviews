Welcome to our buyer's guide for go cart frames. In this section, we will discuss important considerations and features you should look for when purchasing a go cart frame. We aim to provide you with valuable information to make an informed decision before buying. 


### Materials and Construction

The materials and construction of a go cart frame play a crucial role in determining its durability, strength, and weight. Some common materials used for frames include steel, aluminum, and titanium. Steel frames are generally stronger and more affordable, but they can be heavier. Aluminum frames offer a balance between strength and weight, while titanium frames are lightweight yet strong. Consider your budget, weight preferences, and intended usage when choosing the material of your go cart frame.

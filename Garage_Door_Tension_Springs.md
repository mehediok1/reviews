## FAQ


### What are garage door tension springs?

Garage door tension springs are a critical component of your garage door system, responsible for providing balance and assisting in the opening and closing of the door. These springs come in two types - extension springs and torsion springs - and are available in various sizes and capacities depending on the weight and size of your door. 

They are designed to counterbalance the weight of your garage door, making it easier for you to open and close the door manually. Tension springs are highly stressed components of the door system, making their installation and maintenance a safety concern that should be handled by a professional technician. 


### Why do I need to replace my garage door tension springs?

Tension springs have a limited lifespan due to their continuous use and exposure to elements such as dust and moisture. Over time, they can become worn, rusty, or inefficient, leading to a variety of issues such as sagging or creaking doors, uneven operation, and potential safety hazards. Replacing your garage door springs regularly ensures that your door operates smoothly and remains in good working condition. 

It is recommended to have your garage door springs checked by a professional technician at least once a year. If you notice any signs of wear, damage, or unusual noise when operating your garage door, it might be time to replace the tension springs. Doing so will not only improve the safety and performance of your door but may also help prevent costly repairs or replacement of the entire door system. 


### Should I install garage door tension springs myself or hire a professional?

Installing or replacing garage door tension springs is highly recommended to be done by a professional technician with experience in garage door repair and maintenance. This is because tension springs are under high stress during operation, making their installation and removal potentially hazardous if done improperly. 

Professional technicians have the necessary skills and knowledge to safely install or replace garage door tension springs while ensuring proper balance and function of your door. Attempting to handle these springs yourself could lead to injuries or even damage to your door, making it imperative to leave the task to the professionals. 


### How often should I replace my garage door tension springs?

The frequency of replacing garage door tension springs depends on several factors, including the type of springs used, the frequency of usage, and the environmental conditions under which your door is exposed. As a general guideline, most garage door springs last between 5-7 years if properly maintained. 

It is highly recommended to have your garage door system inspected by a professional technician at least once a year, who can check the condition of your tension springs and advise on any necessary replacements or repairs. Regular inspections and timely replacement of worn or damaged springs help ensure the optimal performance and safety of your garage door system. 


### What are the advantages of using extension springs over torsion springs?

Both extension springs and torsion springs have their advantages and disadvantages, primarily based on your garage door's design, weight, and dimensions. Extension springs are generally more cost-effective and easier to install as they can be found in hardware stores and even purchased online. They are often used on sectional overhead garage doors with fewer curves and a relatively lightweight structure. 

On the other hand, torsion springs are more durable and efficient in providing a smoother operation, making them a preferred choice for heavier, oversized, or high-performance garage doors with multiple sections and more extensive usage. Torsion springs are typically used on garage doors with a horizontal track assembly or those that are designed for the higher weight capacity. 


### Can I use different size garage door tension springs if the capacity is the same?

While it may be tempting to use a different size of garage door tension spring with the same capacity in your garage door system, it is not advisable. Each tension spring is specifically crafted to match the size, weight, and dimensions of the door it is intended to serve. Swapping out springs of different sizes may result in an unbalanced door, which can lead to safety hazards and potential damage to your door and hardware. 

When considering the replacement or upgrade of your garage door tension springs, ensure that you consult with a professional technician who can assess your door's specifications and recommend the best suitable springs to maintain optimal performance and safety. Remember, using the wrong size or type of spring can lead to a host of problems and should be avoided at all costs.

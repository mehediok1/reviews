### Material

The material of a stock pot plays a significant role in its durability and performance. The most common materials for stock pots are stainless steel, aluminum, and cast iron.

If you frequently entertain guests or have a larger family, a larger stock pot could be beneficial. However, if you have limited storage space or cook for fewer people, a smaller size might be more appropriate. 


### Handle and Lid

A stock pot with a comfortable and secure handle is crucial for ease of use. Look for pots with reinforced handles that can withstand high temperatures and provide a firm grip. A tight-fitting lid is also essential to prevent spills and keep heat inside while the meal is cooking. Make sure the lid fits securely and is made of heat-resistant material. 


### Additional Features

There are a few extra features to consider when purchasing a 12 Qt stock pot. Non-stick coatings can make cleanup easier, while induction compatibility can be beneficial if you use an induction cooktop.

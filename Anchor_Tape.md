## FAQ


### What is Anchor Tape?

Anchor Tape is a versatile adhesive tape designed to secure items to various surfaces securely. Its unique formulation allows it to stick to different materials like plastic, wood, metal, and fabric more effectively than traditional adhesive tapes. This makes it an ideal choice for tasks like hanging posters, mounting cameras, and even repairing household items. 

Anchor Tapes come in different sizes and strengths, catering to various needs. The tapes are known for their high bonding strength, resistance to water and UV rays, and easy peel off feature. This combination of features makes Anchor Tape an indispensable tool for both professional and DIY enthusiasts. 


### How does Anchor Tape work?

Anchor Tapes work through a combination of strong adhesives and a unique backing that ensures better bonding with various surfaces. When you apply the tape, the adhesive starts to form a strong bond with the surface, creating a secure hold. While traditional adhesives may fail to stick to certain materials, Anchor Tapes' specially formulated adhesive ensures effective bonding. This makes it more reliable and suitable for different tasks and applications. 

The tapes are also equipped with a special coating that protects the adhesive from environmental factors like water and UV rays. This makes them suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. Moreover, the tape's easy peel off feature lets you remove it without leaving any residue or damaging the surface. 


### Is Anchor Tape safe for the environment?

Yes, Anchor Tapes are eco-friendly and safe for the environment. The tapes have been carefully formulated to minimize the impact on the environment. The adhesives used in these tapes are VOC-free, making them safe for the home and office. Moreover, the tapes are recyclable, which reduces waste in landfills. 

Additionally, Anchor Tapes are considered safer than nails or other alternatives for mounting tasks. This minimizes the risk of puncture injuries, especially when it comes to tasks like hanging pictures in homes with young children. So, using Anchor Tapes is a more sustainable and safer option for the environment and home safety. 


### What are the different types of Anchor Tapes?

Anchor Tapes come in various types to serve different purposes. The most common ones are as follows: 
1. Clear VHB High-Strength Tape - This tape is perfect for mounting objects on non-visible surfaces. It is often used for mounting signs, light fixtures, and cameras. 2. Black VHB High-Strength Tape - This is similar to the clear tape but has a black finish, making it ideal for tasks where a black tape is preferable. 

There is also a Dual Lock Adhesive Tape - this tape features a unique double-sided adhesive, perfect for holding objects together. It can be used for a variety of tasks, including mounting mirrors and shelves. Finally, there are special tapes for hanging fabric panels, wallpaper, and more. With a wide range of products, Anchor Tapes cater to a variety of mounting needs and applications. 


### How can I choose the right Anchor Tape?

To choose the right Anchor Tape, consider the following factors: 
1. Surface Type: The material you plan to attach the object to will guide you in choosing the right adhesive. If the surface is smooth, go for a tape with a low tack backing. For rough surfaces, a high-tack tape works better. 2. Load Capacity: The weight of the object will determine the tape's strength needed. Heavier items require stronger tapes, while lighter items can use lower-strength tapes. 

3. Environmental Factors: If the object needs to withstand harsh weather conditions or direct sunlight for extended periods, opt for a UV-resistant and weather-resistant tape. The same applies if the object will be mounted in a damp area, as water-resistant tapes would be the right choice. 4. Color and Finish: Depending on the aesthetics of the mounting project, choose an appropriate color and finish for the tape. For example, clear tapes are ideal when mounting items where the tape's visibility should be minimal. 


### What are the advantages of using Anchor Tapes?

Anchor Tapes offer several advantages over traditional adhesives and mounting options. Some of the main benefits include: 
1. Versatility: Anchor Tapes can stick to a wide variety of surfaces without compromising their holding power. This makes them suitable for a large range of applications. 2. Strength: Anchor Tapes are incredibly strong, ensuring that nothing slips or falls once attached. 

3. Durability: These tapes are resistant to harsh environmental factors, including water and sunlight. This makes them a reliable choice for outdoor mounting tasks. 4. Easy Application: Anchor Tapes are easy to apply and remove, without damaging the surface. This provides greater convenience and flexibility for numerous installation tasks.

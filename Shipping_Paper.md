### Types of Shipping Paper

There are different types of shipping paper available, each with unique properties that may suit specific packaging needs. Common types include bubble wrap, foam inserts, and plain paper or cardboard. Bubble wrap provides cushioning and protection, while foam inserts offer a sturdy, lightweight solution. Plain paper or cardboard may be suitable for lightweight or flat items.

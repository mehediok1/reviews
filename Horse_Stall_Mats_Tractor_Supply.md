### How do Horse Stall Mats work?

Horse stall mats work by providing a layer of protection between the horse's hooves and the stall floor, as well as offering the horse a comfortable, slip-resistant surface to stand and lie down on. They absorb the impact generated by the horse's movements, which can help prevent injuries and discomfort caused by hard, unyielding surfaces.

### How do I install Horse Stall Mats?

Installing horse stall mats is a relatively straightforward process. The mat should be placed on the floor of the stall, making sure it covers the entire surface and provides adequate depth for optimal protection. Many horse stall mats feature a self-adhesive or rubberized bottom that can be attached to the floor, which helps prevent the mat from shifting or moving around in the stall. 

Some horse stall mat models may require additional steps to secure the mat in place, such as using nails or screws. Tractor Supply's website or in-store staff can provide you with detailed installation instructions, as well as answer any specific questions or concerns you may have about installing your new stall mat.

However, on average, a serving (1 tablespoon) of Pistachio Coffee Syrup contains around 25-30 calories. This is relatively low compared to other coffee syrups, which can contain up to 50 calories or more per serving. 

It's essential to note that while Pistachio Coffee Syrup is relatively low in calories, it is still high in sugar. One serving contains around 6-7 grams of sugar, so it's essential to consume it in moderation, especially if you're following a low-sugar diet. You can also consider using it as a treat, like an occasional topping for your coffee or desserts, rather than a daily addition. 


### Is Pistachio Coffee Syrup suitable for vegans?

Yes, Pistachio Coffee Syrup is typically suitable for vegans. Most brands utilize plant-based ingredients, such as pistachio nuts, sugar, and water, to create their syrups. Additionally, they often avoid using animal products or derivatives, which makes their products vegan-friendly. However, it's always recommended to check the product's label or contact the manufacturer to ensure that it meets your specific vegan dietary requirements. 

Moreover, since Pistachio Coffee Syrup is a plant-based product, it can be an excellent choice for those who are looking for vegan-friendly options to enhance their coffee experience.

Pistachio Coffee Syrup can typically last for 6-8 weeks after being opened, but this depends on the specific product and the storage conditions. It's essential to store the syrup in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight, to maintain its quality and freshness. Avoid leaving the syrup open to air for extended periods, as this can cause it to spoil more quickly. 

If you notice any off odors, discoloration, or changes in the syrup's consistency, it's best to discard it and purchase a new bottle. Proper storage and usage can help you enjoy your Pistachio Coffee Syrup for an extended period and ensure that it remains safe for consumption. Remember to always check the product's label for any specific storage instructions or recommendations. 


### Can Pistachio Coffee Syrup be used in baking?

Yes, Pistachio Coffee Syrup can be used in baking. Its flavorful and sweet taste makes it an excellent addition to various baked goods, such as cakes, cookies, and pies. You can use it as a topping or incorporate it into your cake and cookie batter for an added nutty and sweet touch. Additionally, you can use Pistachio Coffee Syrup as a glaze for your pastries or even as a filling for your desserts. 

It's essential to note that since Pistachio Coffee Syrup is high in sugar, you should use it in moderation when baking.

Remove any existing soil or vegetation from the area, and rake the ground to create a flat and smooth surface. 

Spread a layer of sand or crushed stone over the raked area to create a base for the gravel. Rake the sand or crushed stone to create a level base, and then spread the gravel stones evenly over the base. Use a rake to help position the stones in the desired positions and to fill any gaps between the stones.

This can help reduce maintenance requirements and ensure that your Gravel Stone landscape remains attractive and functional for years to come. 


### Are Gravel Stones environmentally friendly?

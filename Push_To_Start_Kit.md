## FAQ


### What is a push to start kit and how does it work?

A push to start kit is a device that helps users start manual transmission vehicles with a single push of a button, rather than turning the key manually. It works by electrically assisting the starting process, making it easier to start the engine, especially in cold or difficult conditions. The kit is connected to the battery and wired to the starter motor, allowing the user to start the car by pushing a button instead of manually turning the ignition. 

The push to start kit is a convenient and practical solution for people who have difficulty starting their manual cars, without affecting the safety or performance of the vehicle. It is designed to work with both gas and diesel engines, and can be installed in minutes without any modifications to the existing wiring. 


### What are the benefits of using a push to start kit?

There are several benefits to using a push to start kit. Firstly, it makes starting a manual transmission vehicle much easier, especially in cold weather conditions when the engine may not start easily. This can be particularly useful for people with arthritis or other physical conditions that make it difficult to turn the key manually. 

Secondly, it can improve the safety of the driving experience, as there is less chance of the engine misfiring or stalling during the starting process. This can help reduce the risk of accidents caused by a vehicle that doesn't start smoothly. Additionally, it can also save time and reduce wear and tear on the starter motor, as the pushing action is less forceful than turning the key manually. 


### Can I install a push to start kit myself?

Yes, many people are able to install a push to start kit themselves, without the need for professional help. The installation process is usually straightforward and easy to follow, with detailed instructions provided in the kit. However, it's always a good idea to consult the user manual and any relevant online resources before attempting Installation, to ensure that you're following the correct procedure and to avoid any potential issues. 

When installing a push to start kit, it's important to take safety precautions, such as disconnecting the battery, wearing protective gloves, and working in a well-lit area. It's also a good idea to have a secondary source of power, such as a portable battery, in case you need to jump-start the car if the push to start kit fails to work. If you're unsure about any aspect of the installation process, or if you don't feel confident about installing the kit yourself, it's always a good idea to consult a professional mechanic. 


### What is the lifespan of a push to start kit?

The lifespan of a push to start kit can vary depending on the quality of the kit, the frequency of use, and the conditions in which it's used.

They use high-quality components that are designed to withstand the wear and tear of regular use, and are built to last. 

To ensure that your push to start kit lasts as long as possible, it's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions for use and maintenance. This may include regular cleaning, lubrication, and inspection of the components, as well as avoiding excessive force when using the kit. If you encounter any issues with the kit, it's always a good idea to consult the user manual or a professional mechanic for advice on how to resolve the problem. 


### Are there any compatibility issues with push to start kits?

Push to start kits are generally compatible with a wide range of manual transmission vehicles, including both gas and diesel engines.

### What is the Edge Pull technique?

The Edge Pull technique is a method used in construction and climbing for moving materials or people along a fixed structure, such as a cliff or a wall. It involves pulling a rope or sling attached to the edge of the structure to create tension, which can then be used to lift or move a load or person.

Regularly inspecting and maintaining your non-slip stair treads is essential to ensure their long-lasting performance and safety. Check for signs of wear, such as cracks, chipping, or excessive wear and tear, and repair or replace any damaged components promptly.

Cleaning and maintaining your non-slip stair treads is simple.

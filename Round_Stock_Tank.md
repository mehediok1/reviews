When choosing a round stock tank, there are several important features to consider. Additionally, you'll want to think about the location, size, and installation of your tank. 


### Important Features

1. Material: Round stock tanks are typically made from metal or plastic. Metal tanks are stronger and more durable but tend to be more expensive.

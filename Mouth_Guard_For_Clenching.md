## Buyer's Guide

Mouthguards are essential for individuals who grind or clench their teeth, also known as bruxism. These devices help protect your teeth from damage and can also alleviate headaches, earaches, and other symptoms associated with bruxism. In this buyer's guide, we will discuss the important features to consider when selecting a mouthguard for clenching, as well as some general advice to help you make the best choice for your needs. 


### Types of Mouth Guards

There are several types of mouth guards available in the market, including custom-fitted, boil-and-bite, and over-the-counter. Custom-fitted mouth guards are created using dental impressions and are designed to provide the best protection and comfort. Boil-and-bite mouth guards require you to boil the guard and then bite it, allowing it to mold to your teeth. Over-the-counter mouth guards can be purchased at a drugstore without the need for a prescription. It is essential to choose the right type of mouth guard based on your specific needs and preferences. 


### Material

Mouth guards are typically made from silicone, acrylic, or polyethylene. Silicone mouth guards are soft and flexible, providing comfort and ease of use. Acrylic mouth guards are more rigid and can be customized for better protection. Polyethylene mouth guards are lightweight and durable, making them a popular choice for athletes. When selecting a mouth guard, consider the material that best suits your needs in terms of protection, comfort, and ease of use. 


### Comfort and Fit

A well-fitted mouth guard is crucial for comfort and effectiveness. Make sure the mouth guard covers all of your teeth, including the molars, and fits snugly without causing any discomfort or interference with your breathing. Custom-fitted mouth guards typically offer the best fit, but boil-and-bite and over-the-counter options can still provide a good fit with proper sizing and adjustments. 


### Quality and Durability

Invest in a high-quality mouth guard that is durable and long-lasting. A well-made mouth guard will provide better protection and comfort over time. Look for mouth guards with a high rating and good customer reviews. Additionally, consider purchasing a mouth guard case or storage container to keep your mouth guard clean and organized when not in use. 


## FAQ


### What are mouth guards for clenching?

Mouth guards for clenching, also known as night guards or bruxism guards, are specialized dental devices designed to protect your teeth from the damaging effects of grinding and clenching during sleep. These devices are custom-made to fit over your upper or lower teeth and are typically made of a flexible, thermoplastic material to provide comfort and durability. 

Wearing a mouth guard for clenching can help alleviate symptoms such as jaw pain, headaches, and tooth sensitivity. It can also prevent damage to your teeth, fillings, and other dental work due to the excessive force of grinding and clenching your teeth during sleep. If you grind your teeth frequently or experience symptoms related to bruxism, a mouth guard for clenching may be recommended by your dentist. 


### How are mouth guards for clenching different from sports mouth guards?

Mouth guards for clenching and sports mouth guards are designed for different purposes. Sports mouth guards are designed to protect the teeth, gums, and lips from injuries sustained during physical activities like sports or martial arts. They typically cover the entire upper or lower teeth and are made of a more rigid material to provide a better fit and increased protection. 

On the other hand, mouth guards for clenching are specifically designed to address the issue of teeth grinding and clenching during sleep. They are tailored to provide a snug fit and are made from a more flexible material to ensure maximum comfort. Sports mouth guards may not be as effective in addressing the problems associated with bruxism, as they are not designed to accommodate the specific movements and forces associated with teeth grinding. 


### How are mouth guards for clenching made?

Mouth guards for clenching are made using a custom-fitting process that involves several steps. Your dentist will first take an impression of your teeth to create a detailed mold, which will serve as the basis for your mouth guard. This mold is then sent to a dental laboratory, where the mouth guard is crafted using a thermoplastic material. 

Once completed, the mouth guard will be returned to your dentist. Your dentist will then adjust the mouth guard to ensure a proper fit and comfort before providing you with your custom-made mouth guard. It's essential to follow your dentist's instructions on proper use and cleaning of your mouth guard to ensure its effectiveness and longevity. 


### How do I know if I need a mouth guard for clenching?

If you exhibit symptoms such as jaw pain, headaches, tooth sensitivity, or notice that your teeth have become worn or damaged over time, you may be experiencing bruxism – the medical term for grinding and clenching of teeth. Your dentist can help determine if you need a mouth guard for clenching by conducting a comprehensive examination and review of your dental history. 

During this examination, your dentist may also evaluate your jaw function, bite, and muscle activity to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. If a mouth guard for clenching is deemed necessary, your dentist will work with you to create a custom-made device to help alleviate your symptoms and protect your teeth from further damage. 


### Can mouth guards for clenching be used during the day?

Mouth guards for clenching are primarily designed for use during sleep, as this is when most people unconsciously grind or clench their teeth. However, your dentist may recommend using a daytime mouth guard if you grind your teeth during the day due to stress or anxiety. These guards are typically more comfortable and less bulky than those designed for nighttime use. 

If you find yourself clenching or grinding your teeth during the day, it's essential to identify and address the underlying cause of your symptoms. Your dentist may recommend stress management techniques, such as relaxation exercises or counseling, to help you cope with the issue. In some cases, they may even recommend a mouth guard for daytime use to provide relief from the symptoms and protect your teeth. 


### How do I clean and maintain my mouth guard for clenching?

Proper cleaning and maintenance of your mouth guard are crucial for ensuring its effectiveness and longevity. You should clean your mouth guard after each use by gently brushing it with a soft-bristled toothbrush and a mild, non-abrasive toothpaste. Rinse the mouth guard thoroughly with water after cleaning. 

It's also essential to store your mouth guard in a protective case, preferably the one provided by your dentist. This helps keep the mouth guard clean and free from contaminants when not in use. Avoid exposing your mouth guard to extreme temperatures or direct sunlight, as this can cause the material to warp or become discolored.

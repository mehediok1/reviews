## Buyer's Guide

Welcome to our buyer's guide for outside tables! In this section, we'll discuss essential features, considerations, and expert advice to help you make the perfect purchase for your outdoor space. Without further ado, let's dive into the world of outside tables. 


### Size and Shape

The size and shape of an outside table play a crucial role in determining its functionality and suitability for your space. Consider the following factors when selecting the right size and shape for your table: 
1. Available space in your outdoor area 2. The number of people you typically entertain 3. The desired shape (square, rectangle, round, or oval) for your table


### Material

Outside tables are constructed from various materials, each offering its own set of advantages and drawbacks. Some popular materials include: 
1. Wood: Provides a natural aesthetic but may require more maintenance. 2. Metal: Durable and low-maintenance but can be prone to rust if not properly coated. 3. Plastic: Lightweight and low-maintenance but may not be as sturdy as other materials. 4. Aluminum: Lightweight, rust-resistant, and low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for outdoor furniture. 


### Weather Resistance

Outside tables should be designed to withstand the elements, including rain, snow, and excessive sunlight. Look for products with weather-resistant materials, powder-coated finishes, and UV protection to ensure your table lasts as long as possible. Additionally, consider whether your table requires easy disassembly and storage during harsh weather conditions. 


### Maintenance and Care

Even the most robust outside table will benefit from proper maintenance and care. Familiarize yourself with your table's care instructions and adhere to them regularly. This may include cleaning, oiling wooden surfaces, and protecting metal components from rust and corrosion. By investing a little time in maintenance, you can keep your outside table looking beautiful for years to come. 


## FAQ


### Do the outside tables come in different sizes?

Yes, they do. Our roundup features a variety of outside tables in different sizes. Some of the sizes mentioned are 48 inches, 60 inches, and 72 inches. Choosing the right size depends on the amount of space you have and the number of people you want to accommodate at your table. Consider the dimensions of the space where you plan to place the table and the expected number of users to get the right fit. 

Most of these tables are extendable, which means you can increase their size during gatherings to accommodate more people. However, in case you frequently host many people, it is advisable to opt for a larger stable table that doesn't require additional setup for each event. It will make hosting a breeze! 


### What are some popular materials used for making outside tables?

There are several materials used to make outside tables, including wood, metal, and composite materials. Wood is a popular choice due to its natural aesthetic appeal and the warmth it brings to the surrounding. However, proper care is needed to preserve it over time. Metal tables are more durable and can easily withstand harsh weather conditions. Composites like teak or recycled materials are also an option, offering eco-friendliness and resistance to weather and stains. 

It's essential to consider the material's durability, maintenance requirements, and aesthetics when picking the right one for your outdoor setting. For high-traffic areas where the table will be exposed to harsh weather conditions and heavy use, a durable and low-maintenance material is advisable. If you're more concerned about style and can handle some extra care, perhaps a wooden table is right for you. 


### How can I ensure my outdoor table is weather-resistant?

Protecting a wooden table is crucial. Regularly treat the wood with weather-resistant sealant or oil to prevent warping, rotting, and fading. Store the table in a dry location during the winter months. Materials like metal or composite are inherently weather-resistant, so they don't require any additional step. However, they still need to be rinsed off after usage and kept clean to avoid buildup of dirt and dampness that may lead to other issues. 

Regardless of the material used, it's always good to consider a table with a UV-resistant finish, which can help to protect the table from sun damage. Additionally, look for warranties that cover damage caused by weather elements to ensure the durability of your purchase. If possible, purchase from a reputable manufacturer that has a good track record for offering weather-resistant tables. 


### Are the outside tables suitable for all weather conditions?

Not all tables are suitable for all weather conditions. Wooden tables require extra care to protect from harsh weather elements. They should be treated with weather-resistant sealant or oil, stored indoors during winter months, and ideally, brought inside during heavy rainfall or snow. Regular maintenance is also needed to preserve the wood's quality. 

Some materials like metal or composite, however, can easily withstand different weather conditions. They don't require extra care, and even harsh conditions won't harm them. Checking the weather-resistant features of the material and the overall construction of the table helps you make an informed decision on whether it suits your climate or not. 


### Can the outdoor tables be used for indoor use?

While outside tables are typically built to withstand harsh outdoor conditions, they can certainly be used in indoor settings. Wooden tables with a weather-resistant finish, for example, can hold up well in indoor environments where they are protected from direct exposure to rain or snow. Just ensure the space is dry and not prone to wetting or high humidity levels. 

Metal tables or composite materials are suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. These materials are designed to be weather-resistant and are durable, ensuring their longevity in any setting. If you plan to use the table indoors regularly, opt for a table made of composite materials as it offers both style and practicality without requiring additional maintenance. 


### What are some useful features to consider for an outside table?

Some useful features to think about when selecting an outside table include portability, durability, and weather-resistance. Portability is important if you want a table that is easy to move around or store during inclement weather. A stable and well-balanced design is essential for tables that will be used in the wind or on uneven surfaces. Weather-resistant materials, UV protection, and a warranty also help enhance the table's usability and lifetime. Furthermore, consider the table’s aesthetics to ensure it complements your outdoor living space. 

Extra features like an umbrella holder, built-in planters, or wheels can also add value and functionality to your outside table. Evaluate all these aspects to pick the table that best matches your unique needs and preferences. By taking these factors into account, you'll better ensure that you purchase a table that is both practical and eye-catching, enhancing the overall ambiance of your outdoor area.

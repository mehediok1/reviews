It uses electricity to heat up, making it an energy-efficient alternative to traditional stovetop cooking. Electric cookers come with various bake settings, allowing you to cook different types of food at different temperatures.

1) Convection ovens, which use a fan to circulate hot air, providing faster and more even cooking results; 
2) Toaster ovens, which are compact and offer various cooking functions, including toasting, broiling, and baking; 
3) Air fryers, which are smaller in size and designed specifically for air frying, offering a healthier alternative to traditional frying methods; and 4) Combination ovens, which provide both convection and steaming functions, allowing you to cook a wide range of dishes with ease. 

The choice of the best electric cooker for you will depend on your specific needs, preferences, and the amount of cooking you plan to do. Some factors to consider when choosing an electric cooker include size, cooking capacity, temperature range, user-friendliness, and additional features such as programmability and self-cleaning. 


### How should I choose the right electric cooker?

Choosing the right electric cooker for your needs can be overwhelming given the variety of options available. However, here are some key factors to consider when making your decision: 
1) Determine your cooking needs and preferences, such as your preferred cooking methods, food types, and cooking frequency; 
2) Consider the size and cooking capacity of the electric cooker, making sure it is appropriate for your family size and the amount of cooking you plan to do;

### What is the difference between electric cookers and convection ovens?

While both electric cookers and convection ovens use electricity to generate heat for cooking purposes, they differ in some key aspects: 
1) Size and capacity: Electric cookers typically come in a larger size, with more cooking space and higher capacity, making them suitable for larger family gatherings or preparing multiple dishes at the same time. In contrast, convection ovens are smaller and more compact, designed for individual use or for smaller-scale cooking tasks. 2) Cooking functions: Electric cookers are versatile and offer a wide range of cooking options, including baking, roasting, broiling, and convection cooking. On the other hand, convection ovens focus primarily on convection cooking, which uses a fan to circulate hot air for faster and more even cooking results. 3) Price point: Electric cookers are generally more expensive than convection ovens, due to their larger size, higher capacity, and more extensive range of cooking functions. 

The choice between an electric cooker and a convection oven will depend on your specific needs, budget, and preferences. If you require a multifunctional appliance with a larger cooking capacity and more cooking options, an electric cooker might be the better choice. However, if you are looking for a more compact, budget-friendly appliance specifically designed for convection cooking, a convection oven would be the more suitable option. 


### What is the lifespan of an electric cooker?

The lifespan of an electric cooker can vary depending on factors such as the brand, model, usage, and maintenance. On average, a well-maintained and properly used electric cooker can last between 10 to 15 years. However, some less expensive models might have a shorter lifespan due to lower build quality and fewer features. 

To ensure a long and trouble-free lifespan for your electric cooker, it is essential to follow the manufacturer's guidelines for usage and cleaning, regularly inspect the appliance for visible damages or wear, and promptly address any concerns or issues that arise. By taking proper care of your electric cooker, you can greatly extend its lifespan and enjoy its benefits for many years to come.

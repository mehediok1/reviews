### Color Selection and Coordination

When choosing pastel lavender products, consider the color scheme of your existing decor or outfit.

For skincare products, the fragrance can last anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of hours, depending on the concentration of the scent in the formula, the type of skin, and the product's consistency. It's essential to understand that fragrances in skincare products can be a potential allergen for some individuals, even if the scent is pleasant. Therefore, it's always a good idea to patch test new skincare products before use to ensure you're comfortable with the fragrance and that it suits your skin type. Don't be afraid to consult your dermatologist or esthetician for personalized recommendations on Pastel Lavender skincare products.

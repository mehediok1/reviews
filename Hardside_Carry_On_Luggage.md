In this buyer's guide, we will discuss the essential features to consider when purchasing hardside carry-on luggage, as well as some general advice for selecting the best one for your needs. 


### Materials and Construction

Look for hardside carry-on luggage made from durable materials, such as polycarbonate, ABS, or aluminum. These materials offer resistance to scratches and dents, making it ideal for frequent travelers. Also, check the weight of the luggage and ensure it's light enough for easy handling, especially during air travel. 


### Wheels and Handling

A smooth-rolling wheel system is essential for hardside carry-on luggage. Look for luggage with multi-directional spinner wheels, which provide better maneuverability in tight spaces. Additionally, handles should be comfortable to grip and lock in place securely when not in use. Consider bags with ergonomic handles to alleviate stress on your hands and wrists. 


### Size and Compartments

Size is a crucial factor to consider when purchasing hardside carry-on luggage. Make sure the bag falls within airline size requirements (typically 22 x 14 x 9 inches) for domestic travel. Additionally, consider the internal compartments, such as a separate compartment for clothes, a dedicated laptop sleeve, and mesh pockets for easy organization. A TSA-approved lock can provide extra security for your belongings. 


### Design and Aesthetics

Hardside carry-on luggage comes in various designs, materials, and colors. Choose one that matches your personal style and complements your wardrobe. Aesthetics can make a difference in feeling confident about your luggage while on the go. However, remember that a design’s appeal is subjective, so choose one that you feel comfortable with, even if it's not the flashiest option. 


## FAQ


### What is the purpose of hardside carry on luggage?

Hardside carry on luggage is designed to provide durability, protection, and style for your travel essentials. These luggage pieces generally have a rigid shell made of materials like polycarbonate, aluminum, or ABS and are typically wheeled, making it easier to transport your items efficiently through airports and other crowded places. 

Hardside carry on luggage is ideal for those who travel frequently and need their luggage to withstand wear and tear from constant usage. It also helps safeguard your belongings from potential theft and damage during transit, while still being compact enough to fit under the seat or in an overhead bin on most flights. 


### What are the benefits of hardside luggage compared to softside luggage?

Hardside luggage offers several advantages over softside options. Firstly, it is generally more durable and resistant to scratches, dents, and impacts. Secondly, the exterior design can give a sleeker and more professional look, which can be beneficial for business travelers. Finally, hardside luggage typically offers better organization and compartmentalization, with features like built-in pockets, tie-down straps, and multiple compartments. 

However, some drawbacks of hardside luggage include its weight and potential difficulty in fitting into tight spaces, such as overhead bins. Softside luggage might be a better choice for those who prioritize maneuverability and flexibility. Ultimately, the decision between hardside and softside luggage depends on individual needs and preferences. 


### What factors should I consider when choosing a hardside carry on luggage?

When selecting a hardside carry on luggage, consider the following factors to ensure you get the best fit for your needs and budget: weight, durability, style, size, versatility, features, and ease of handling. Think about how much you are willing to carry and how often you plan to travel with the luggage. 

Consider the dimensions and weights of various hardside carryon suitcases, as some models may require additional carry-on fees or have restrictions on airline cabin size. Examine the materials, construction, and warranty, as well as the design and features like wheels, handle, and exterior zippers or pockets. Make sure the luggage has the necessary compartments for your belongings and can accommodate your specific travel style. 


### What are the most common materials used in hardside luggage?

The most common materials used in hardside luggage are polycarbonate, ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) plastic, and aluminum. Each material has its own unique properties and benefits, which might influence your choice of luggage, including durability, weight, and cost. Polycarbonate is a strong, lightweight material known for its durability and resilience. ABS plastic is typically lightweight and cost-effective, while aluminum is often more expensive but highly resistant to wear and tear. 

Each material type has its own pros and cons, so it's essential to evaluate the specific features and prices of different models to determine the best option for your budget and travel needs. Research reviews and compare various luggage options to make an informed decision on which material best suits your preferences. 


### How do I maintain and care for my hardside luggage?

To maintain and care for your hardside luggage, follow these tips: regularly inspect the exterior for any damage or scratches, and address them immediately to prevent worsening the issue. Keep it clean by wiping it down with a soft cloth and mild cleaner, but avoid using abrasive or wet cleaning methods that can damage the finish. 

Handle the luggage carefully to prevent any potential wear and tear. Load it evenly, using the wheels and handles as intended, and avoid overloading to avoid compromising the structural integrity of the luggage. Store it properly when not in use, ideally in a cool and dry place, to prevent any potential damage from prolonged exposure to sunlight or extreme temperature changes.

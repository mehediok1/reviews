Haloumi cheese is a delicious and versatile dairy product that has become increasingly popular in recent years. Originating from Cyprus, this unique cheese offers a firm and salty texture that makes it perfect for barbecuing, grilling, or even frying. If you're new to haloumi or just looking for some tasty inspiration, this buyer's guide will provide you with the knowledge you need to make the best purchase. We'll cover important features, considerations, and general advice about haloumi cheese, so you can enjoy the perfect cheesy meal every time. 


### Type and Milk Source

Haloumi cheese is primarily made from a combination of goat's and sheep's milk. Some varieties may also include cow's milk. The milk source can affect the taste and texture of the cheese. Look for haloumi made from 100% traditional milk sources, as these will typically offer a more authentic flavor. 


### Salt Content

Haloumi cheese is known for its saltiness. This flavor comes from the brining process during production. If you prefer a stronger saltiness, opt for brands that are heavily brined or salted. Remember that less salt can also be a good thing, depending on your personal taste preference and how you plan to use the cheese. 


### Fat Content and Quality

Haloumi cheese can range from low to high-fat content. The fat content affects the melting and overall consumption experience of the cheese. If you're looking for a healthier option, choose a low-fat cheese. However, if you want the cheese to melt smoothly or have a richer flavor, a higher-fat content may be the best choice. Additionally, look for cheese made with organic or grass-fed milk sources, as these will typically offer superior quality and taste. 


### Storage

Proper storage is essential to maintain the quality and taste of haloumi cheese. Wrap the cheese tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and store it in the refrigerator. Haloumi can also be frozen for longer storage, but ensure it is tightly wrapped to prevent any freezer burn. To avoid the cheese from becoming overly slippery or difficult to slice, let it reach room temperature before serving or cooking. 


## FAQ


### What is haloumi cheese and where does it come from?

Haloumi cheese is a type of cheese originating from Cyprus, where it is traditionally made from a combination of goat's and sheep's milk. Known for its salty, briny taste and firm texture, haloumi is popularly used in both Greece and Cyprus. In recent years, haloumi has gained popularity worldwide and can now be found in many specialty food stores and supermarkets. 

The name "haloumi" comes from the Arabic word "halloum, " which means "milk cheese" or "cheese curd. " Haloumi has been a staple in Mediterranean cuisine for centuries, and its unique taste and versatility have led to its widespread adoption in various dishes across the globe, including salads, sandwiches, and grilled dishes. 


### Can haloumi cheese be eaten raw?

Yes, haloumi cheese can be eaten raw. Its firm texture and distinct flavor make it a popular choice for adding a salty, savory bite to salads, sandwiches, and other dishes. Haloumi can be enjoyed thinly sliced on its own, grated over salads, or served as a crudité with your favorite dipping sauce. However, due to its high protein and low-fat content, haloumi can also be grilled or fried, giving it a delicious, slightly crispy exterior while retaining its creamy interior. 

To prepare raw haloumi, simply slice it, grate it over salads or pasta dishes, or crumble it into small pieces for added texture. Alternatively, you can pan-fry sliced haloumi over medium heat until lightly browned and crisp on both sides, then season with fresh herbs, lemon juice, or a drizzle of olive oil. 


### How should haloumi cheese be stored?

Haloumi cheese should be stored in an airtight container to prevent it from drying out, which can lead to a crumbly texture or off-flavors. When stored properly, haloumi can last up to two weeks in the refrigerator. If using within a week or so, keep the cheese wrapped in waxed or parchment paper to help maintain its moisture and freshness. 

To extend the shelf life of haloumi cheese even further, you can also vacuum-seal it in a freezer-safe bag or container. When frozen, haloumi can last for up to six months. To thaw the cheese, simply let it sit in the refrigerator overnight or at room temperature for a few hours. Once thawed, you can use haloumi in your favorite recipes as you would fresh cheese. 


### Is haloumi cheese suitable for people with lactose intolerance?

Haloumi cheese can be considered a lactose-friendly option for people with lactose intolerance. During the traditional cheese-making process, the whey (the liquid part of the milk) is separated from the curds, which are then cooked, pressed, and dried to produce the final cheese. This process results in a cheese with a low lactose content, making it suitable for those with lactose sensitivities or intolerances. 

Additionally, many dairy manufacturers have developed lactose-free versions of haloumi cheese, which can be a good option for those who need to avoid lactose more strictly. Look for lactose-free haloumi in your local grocery store or specialty cheese shop to ensure that you are selecting a product that meets your dietary needs. 


### Does haloumi cheese have any health benefits?

Yes, haloumi cheese is a nutritious and flavorful addition to any diet. It is high in protein and low in fat, making it an excellent choice for those looking to maintain a healthy weight. Haloumi is also rich in calcium, which is essential for maintaining strong bones and teeth. Moreover, it contains small amounts of vitamins A and B12, which support overall eye health and immune function. 

One ounce (28 grams) of haloumi cheese contains approximately 130 calories, 8 grams of protein, 4.5 grams of fat, and 10 grams of carbohydrates. With its low-fat content and high nutrient density, haloumi can be an excellent protein source for vegetarians and vegans who are seeking to incorporate more plant-based foods into their diets. 


### Are there any suitable substitutes for haloumi cheese in recipes?

If you're looking to substitute haloumi cheese in a recipe but are unable to find it or prefer an alternative, there are several options you can consider. Some popular alternatives to haloumi include feta or Greek-style cheeses, such as Kasseri or Pefkisko, which have a similar texture and flavor profile. These cheeses can be easily grilled or pan-fried and offer a similar salty taste to haloumi cheese. 

Another option is to use a firm, crumbly tofu that has been marinated or seasoned to provide a similar taste and texture to haloumi. If using tofu, season it with a mixture of salt, garlic, and lemon juice, then pan-fry or grill it until crispy and golden brown. When paired with fresh herbs, olive oil, or a tangy dressing, tofu can be an excellent substitute for haloumi in a variety of dishes.

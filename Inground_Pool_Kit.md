### Size and Shape

The size and shape of your inground pool kit should be determined by the available space in your backyard, your budget, and your family's needs. Common shapes include rectangular, oval, and circular.

## FAQ


### What is an inground pool kit?

An inground pool kit is a collection of materials and equipment necessary for constructing an inground swimming pool. It typically includes items such as the pool shell, coping tiles, skimmer, drain, and return fitting, among others. The kit can be installed by professionals or DIY enthusiasts who possess the required skills and expertise. 

Inground pool kits offer a cost-effective alternative to traditional in-ground pool installation, as they eliminate the need for expensive custom-made pool shells. However, it's essential to choose a high-quality kit from a reputable manufacturer to ensure durability and safety standards are met. Researching beforehand can help you make an informed decision. 


### What are the main types of inground pool kits?

There are two primary types of inground pool kits: above-ground kits and semi-inground kits. Above-ground kits are designed for installation on existing decks or patios, and they typically have a smaller water capacity than traditional inground pools. On the other hand, semi-inground kits are a hybrid of above-ground and inground pools, with a partial excavation for the pool shell. 

For those seeking a more traditional inground pool experience, full inground kits are available. These kits require the most excavation work and typically have the highest capacity for water. A variety of shapes and sizes are available for these kits, allowing for customization based on the space available and the individual home owner's preferences. 


### What tools and equipment are required for installing an inground pool kit?

To install an inground pool kit, you'll need a set of tools and equipment specific to the manufacturer's instructions. Generally, tools may include a portable power saw, muck bucket and digging tools, a level, a measuring tape, and a wheelbarrow for transporting materials and equipment. Additionally, a power washer can be useful for cleaning the pool shell prior to installation and during the construction process. 

Some inground pool kit manufacturers may offer special installation tools to their customers in the form of a DIY pool kit. These tools and equipment may vary based on the manufacturer and the type of inground pool kit you choose. It's important to review the manufacturer's instructions and list of tools before starting the installation process. 


### What are some of the benefits of owning an inground pool kit?

Owning an inground pool kit brings many benefits to homeowners. First and foremost, it offers a convenient and accessible space for relaxation, exercise, and recreation. An inground pool kit also increases the value of your property, making it a valuable investment for the future. Moreover, it can significantly enhance the aesthetics of your backyard, by creating a focal point that adds to the overall beauty of the landscape. 

Additionally, inground pool kits are designed for durability and low maintenance. They come with strong and resilient pool shells and high-quality accessories, ensuring that they withstand frequent use and harsh weather conditions. With proper care and maintenance, an inground pool kit can provide years of enjoyment for homeowners. 


### What are some of the potential drawbacks of owning an inground pool kit?

While inground pool kits offer numerous benefits, there are also several potential drawbacks to consider. Firstly, they require a significant amount of space, which may not be suitable for all homes or locations. The pool installation process can also be time-consuming and labor-intensive, which can impact your daily routine. 

Another potential drawback is the cost of installation. Although inground pool kits can be more cost-effective than traditional pool installation, there are still expenses such as excavation, landscaping, and installation labor that need to be factored in. Homeowners should do their research and consider all costs before making a purchase. 


### What is the warranty period for an inground pool kit?

The warranty period for an inground pool kit can vary depending on the manufacturer and the specific product you choose. Generally, it's important to review the warranty terms and conditions provided by the manufacturer before making a purchase. Some manufacturers may offer a limited warranty for the pool shell and accessories, while others may provide a more comprehensive warranty. 

Warranty periods can range from a few months to several years, with some manufacturers offering lifetime warranties for certain parts. It's crucial to read the fine print to understand the specific coverage and limitations of the warranty. Familiarizing yourself with the terms and conditions is a crucial step in ensuring a stress-free experience with your inground pool kit.

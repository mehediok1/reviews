### How do I care for hammered copper cookware?

Proper care and maintenance are crucial for ensuring the longevity of hammered copper cookware. It is recommended to hand wash the cookware using mild dish soap and a soft cloth. Avoid using abrasive cleaners, steel wool, or harsh sponges, as they can scratch the surface or damage the lining. Always dry the cookware thoroughly after washing, as moisture can cause corrosion. 

Regular seasoning is also essential for maintaining the non-stick surface of hammered copper cookware. To season, apply a thin layer of cooking oil to the cooking surface and heat the pan slowly for about 15 minutes. Afterward, cool the pan and wipe away any excess oil. This process helps maintain the non-stick surface and prevents food from sticking. 


### Is hammered copper cookware safe to use?

Yes, hammered copper cookware is safe to use when properly maintained. Copper is a natural element and has been used for cooking for centuries. However, some copper cookware products are lined with lead-based sealants, which can pose health risks. To ensure safety, choose cookware that is lined with stainless steel or tin instead. 

Additionally, it is essential to avoid cooking with copper cookware at high temperatures, as the high heat can cause the lining to flake or release potentially hazardous chemicals. By following proper care instructions and adhering to safe cooking practices, hammered copper cookware can be a safe and healthy choice for your kitchen.

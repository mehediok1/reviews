## FAQ


### What is the history behind the Walking Liberty design?

The Walking Liberty design originates from a gold coin created in 1916 as part of the American Gold Eagle series. Designed by Adolph A. Weinman, the coin's obverse image showcases the enigmatic Lady Liberty striding towards the viewer with a torch held in her right hand and an olive branch in her left. Weinman's designs aimed to honor the American Dream and its core values, such as liberty, freedom, and prosperity. 

The Walking Liberty design was later reintroduced in the modern era for commemorative coins and collector items. These newer releases have captured the essence of Weinman's original vision, cementing the Walking Liberty design as a timeless classic in American numismatics. Today, the legendary design remains a symbol of hope and the promise of a better future. 


### What materials is the Walking Liberty design commonly available in?

The Walking Liberty design is typically available in various precious metals, primarily gold, silver, and palladium. Among these options, the most popular version is undoubtedly the gold coin. The original 27.35-mm gold coin was produced in three weights: 25-dollar, 20-dollar, and 10-dollar denominations, which were later replaced by 20-dollar and 10-dollar coins with a 33 mm diameter, all struck in 24-karat gold. Modern versions of the Walking Liberty design are also available in 1-ounce, ½-ounce, and ¼-ounce gold coins. 

Silver Walking Liberty coins are another popular option. These are available in many different sizes, from quarter-dollar to one-ounce, as well as in various limited-edition collections. In recent years, there has also been an increase in demand for palladium Walking Liberty coins, which share the same iconic design elements as their gold and silver counterparts. Regardless of the metal choice, the captivating Walking Liberty design continues to captivate collectors worldwide. 


### Who is the artist behind the Walking Liberty design?

The artist responsible for the Walking Liberty design is Adolph Alexander Weinman. Born in 1870, Weinman was a German-American sculptor and architect who made significant contributions to the world of art and design. He was an accomplished artist in various disciplines, including coinage and commemorative pieces. 

Apart from the Walking Liberty design, Weinman also designed the Winged Liberty Head (Mercury) dollar, which was a numismatic milestone in its own right. Sadly, Weinman's life was cut short in 1955 at the age of 85, but his legacy in the realm of coinage and American numismatics remains unrivaled. The Walking Liberty design is both enduring and evocative, as it represents the pinnacle of Weinman's illustrious artistic career. 


### What is the rarity of Walking Liberty coins?

Walking Liberty coins, particularly the original series of 20 and 25-dollar gold coins, are considered rare due to their limited mintage. The 20-dollar gold coin, for example, was struck in a comparatively modest number of around 70,000 pieces, with approximately two-thirds of these coins being graded by the Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS). 

The Walking Liberty design has remained popular with collectors, leading to increased demand for these rare coins in recent years. Limited edition collections containing various sizes of silver and palladium Walking Liberty coins have emerged, further elevating the profile of these captivating numismatic treasures. Despite the scarcity of these coins, new investors and collectors have opportunities to acquire Walking Liberty coins or their derivatives through reputable dealers and online platforms. 


### Are there any variations of the Walking Liberty design?

Yes, there have been variations of the Walking Liberty design throughout the years. The design was initially featured on the 25-dollar, 20-dollar, and 10-dollar denominations of gold coins in 1916 and 1917. However, the higher-denomination coins were later discontinued due to the onset of World War I. Thereafter, the Walking Liberty design reappeared on the now more commonly known denominations of 20-dollar and 10-dollar gold coins in 1918, with these denominations continuing until 1933. 

In the modern era, the Walking Liberty design has been replicated in various sizes and precious metals, such as gold, silver, and palladium. There have been numerous limited-edition collections released over the years, many of which have commemorated special occasions or anniversaries. These collector coins often showcase variations in engravings, mint marks, finishes, or other design elements, making each piece unique and coveted among collectors. Despite these variations, the essence of the Walking Liberty design endures, making it an enduring symbol of hope, freedom, and the American Dream. 


### What is the value of a Walking Liberty coin?

The value of a Walking Liberty coin depends on several factors, including the coin's condition, rarity, and precious metal content. Original Walking Liberty 20-dollar and 10-dollar gold coins from 1916 and 1917 are particularly rare, as they were struck in relatively small numbers. In addition, the coin's grading by a reputable organization, such as the Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS) or the Numismatic Guaranty Corporation (NGC), affects its perceived authenticity and worth. When combined with the coin's precious metal content, these factors contribute to the overall value of a Walking Liberty coin. 

While the average collector may pay anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand dollars for a Walking Liberty coin, high-quality and rare coins can frequently fetch tens of thousands of dollars, even reaching high six figures at auction. It is essential for collectors to conduct thorough research and consult with experienced dealers or numismatic experts before making a purchase to ensure a fair and accurate valuation of these valuable numismatic treasures.

## Buyer's Guide

Street tires, also known as passenger car tires, are the most common and versatile tires used for everyday driving. They are designed to provide a comfortable ride, excellent handling, and good traction for various road conditions. In this buyer's guide, we will discuss the important features, considerations, and general advice for selecting the right street tires to match your driving needs. 


### Types of Street Tires

Street tires are broadly categorized into four types, based on their tread pattern and design, as well as their intended use. These types include: All-season tires, Summer tires, Winter tires, and Ultra-high-performance tires (UHP). It is essential to choose the right tire type for your vehicle and driving conditions. 


### Size, Width, and Aspect Ratio

When shopping for street tires, it is crucial to pay attention to the tire size, width, and aspect ratio. These measurements will determine the tire's overall performance and fit on your vehicle. Make sure you check your vehicle's owner manual or consult a tire professional to ensure the correct tire specifications. Proper tire sizing leads to better performance, handling, and safety during your drives. 


### Tread Pattern and Wear Lifespan

The tread pattern of a street tire plays a significant role in its grip on the road, handling, and wear lifespan. Common tread patterns include symmetric, asymmetric, and non-directional. Each type has its advantages and disadvantages. For instance, symmetric tread patterns offer better grip in a straight line, while asymmetric tread patterns provide better cornering grip. Furthermore, the wear lifespan of a tire depends on its tread pattern, rubber compound, and driving habits. Opting for tires with a longer wear lifespan is generally preferred to reduce replacement costs over time. 


### Brand and Durability

When selecting street tires, it's essential to consider the brand's reputation for quality and durability. Reputable tire manufacturers like Michelin, Goodyear, Bridgestone, and Continental have extensive research and development programs that ensure their products meet high standards. Their tires typically offer better performance, reliability, and durability, which may justify a slightly higher price point. However, there are also many high-quality, budget-friendly tire options available from other well-established brands. 


## FAQ


### What are street tires?

Street tires, also known as passenger tires, are designed specifically for everyday driving on paved roads, and they offer a balance of traction, handling, and comfort. These tires are made with a variety of compounds and tread patterns to provide optimal performance on typical road conditions. Street tires are not suitable for off-road or high-performance racing applications as they lack the necessary durability and grip. 

Street tires come in various sizes to fit different vehicles, and the most popular ones are those with lower rolling resistance for better fuel economy and reduced wear. Some street tires are also marked with an "M&S" symbol on the sidewall, indicating they meet the minimum requirements for use in mud and snow. 


### What are the differences between street tires and racing tires?

The main distinction between street tires and racing tires lies in their intended use and performance characteristics. Street tires, designed for everyday driving on public roads, prioritize comfort, durability, and even wear over outright performance. They typically offer better ride quality, reduced rolling resistance for better fuel efficiency, and a more quiet ride. 

Racing tires, on the other hand, are specifically built for track use and high-performance driving. They prioritize grip, excellent handling, and the ability to withstand high speeds and punishing track conditions. Racing tires usually have a softer compound and more aggressive tread patterns, which provide better traction and cornering capability but tend to wear out more quickly. 


### What factors should I consider when buying street tires?

When purchasing street tires, consider the following factors to ensure you get the best fit and performance for your vehicle and driving style: 
1) the tire size needed for your vehicle; 
2) the load index, which indicates the weight the tire can safely support; 
3) the speed rating, which shows the maximum speed it can handle; 
4) the tread pattern, which influences the tire's handling, grip, and road noise; and 5) the tire compound, which plays a role in grip, wear, and performance in different weather conditions. 

It's also important to consider the tire's warranty, as some manufacturers offer better coverage on specific issues such as uneven wear, sidewall damage, or manufacturing defects. Additionally, look for tire reviews from reputable sources, as they can provide valuable insights into a tire's performance and reliability. 


### How should I maintain and rotate my street tires?

To ensure your street tires last as long as possible and perform their best, following a proper maintenance and rotation schedule is essential. The recommended rotation schedule varies depending on the manufacturer, but most suggest rotating your tires every 5,000 to 7,500 miles (8,000 to 12,000 km). 

Rotating your tires evenly helps to distribute the wear more evenly, prolonging their life and extending their usefulness. You should also monitor your tire pressure regularly, as underinflated tires can cause premature wear and decrease fuel efficiency. Checking the tire pressure once a week, using a tire pressure gauge, or by observing the tire's appearance when the vehicle has been stationary for some time, can help you determine if the tire pressure is adequate. 


### What are some tips for driving with street tires in different weather conditions?

Street tires can handle a variety of weather conditions, but ensuring safe and reliable vehicle operation requires proper driving techniques. In wet or rainy conditions, avoid hard braking and acceleration, as these can lead to hydroplaning—where your tires lose contact with the road surface. Instead, use a gentle, firm braking pressure, and drive more slowly than usual to allow the tires to generate traction and maintain grip. 

In cold or freezing weather, your tires may lose some of their grip due to temperature-related hardening. To drive safely, be attentive of changing weather conditions, allow more space between vehicles, reduce your speed, and avoid sudden movements. Additionally, check your tire pressure regularly, as underinflated tires in cold weather can contribute to poor driving performance and increased wear. 


### How do I know if my street tires need replacing?

Regularly inspecting your street tires for signs of wear and damage can help you determine if it's time to replace them. Look for the following indicators that your tires may need replacing: 
1) uneven tread wear across or around the tire; 
2) visible cuts, scrapes, or punctures in the tread or sidewall; 
3) bald spots in the tread pattern, where the rubber has completely worn away; and 4) cracks or bulges in the sidewall, indicating structural damage. 

If you notice any of these signs, or if your tires are approaching or beyond their suggested tread depth (less than 2/32nds of an inch or 1.6 mm), it's recommended to replace them to maintain optimal performance and safety. Additionally, rotate your tires regularly, as this can help evenly distribute wear and prolong the lifespan of your street tires.

## Buyer's Guide

If you're in search of the perfect wine, it's time to educate yourself on the skin of the grape. The wine skin, or grape skin, is an essential player in the winemaking process. It's the outer layer, where the color, tannins, and seeds are contained, all of which have a significant impact on the taste and mouthfeel of the wine. In this guide, we will explore the key features and considerations when it comes to the wine skin. 


### Understanding the Wine Skin

The wine skin consists of layers, each contributing to the unique characteristics of the wine. Here's a breakdown of these layers and their roles in the winemaking process: 
1) Epidermis: The outermost layer, which gives color to the wine and provides some bitterness and astringency. 2) Mesocarp: Contains most of the color and tannins, as well as important flavors like cherry, plum, and vanilla. 3) Endocarp: The innermost layer, which houses seeds and also contributes flavor, color, and tannins. 


### How the Wine Skin Affects the Wine Taste and Texture

The wine skin plays a crucial role in determining a wine's taste and feel in your mouth. Here's how: 
1) Color: The pigments in the wine skin are responsible for the red, white, and occasionally pink hues in wine. 2) Tannins: These compounds derived from the skin contribute to the wine's astringency, texture, and aging capabilities. 3) Flavor: The myriad of flavors in wine can be traced back to the chemistry of the wine skin, giving you notes of fruit, spice, and even earthiness. 


### Choosing Wines with the Right Wine Skin

When shopping for wines, consider the wine skin as a key factor in determining what you'll prefer. White wines, for instance, typically have a thinner wine skin than red wines, resulting in lighter, crisper flavors. Red wines, on the other hand, tend to have thicker wine skins, making them more tannic, darkly colored, and full-bodied. If you're unsure, don't hesitate to ask your sommelier or wine expert for recommendations based on your preferences and the wine skin profile. 


### Storing and Preserving Wine Skins

Wines with delicate wine skins need special care when it comes to storage and preservation. Here are some general tips to ensure your wine maintains its peak quality: 
1) Temperature: Store your wine at a consistent temperature, away from direct sunlight. 2) Humidity: Maintain a humid environment to prevent the corks from drying out, allowing air to enter and spoil the wine. 3) Upright Storage: Lay your wines flat on their side to keep the wine skin from touching the cork and preventing cork rot. Proper storage will help your wine maintain and enjoy its wine skin characteristics for longer.

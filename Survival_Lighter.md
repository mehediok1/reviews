## Buyer's Guide

When venturing into the great outdoors, it is essential to have reliable tools at your disposal. One such tool that is indispensable in any survival situation is a survival lighter. These lighters are specifically designed to withstand harsh weather conditions and still get the job done. Let's take a closer look at the features you should consider when purchasing a survival lighter. 


### Durability

Durability is a critical factor when choosing a survival lighter. A lighter that can withstand being dropped, submerged in water, or exposed to extreme temperatures is an essential investment. Look for lighters made from high-quality materials, such as stainless steel or brass, which can withstand wear and tear and be used for an extended period. 


### Waterproofing

Since wet conditions are often unavoidable when camping, waterproofing is another important feature to consider. Waterproof lighters enclose the flame source and ignition system to protect them from moisture. Ensure the lighter you choose is safe to use underwater and can still function when wet or soaked. 


### Ease of Use

In a survival situation, it's crucial to have a lighter that is easy to use. Look for lighters with a simple, user-friendly design, an ergonomic grip, and a secure closing mechanism to prevent accidental ignition. Also, consider lighters with a built-in safety feature, such as a child-lock button, to protect curious hands. 


### Portability

Portability is another essential factor when selecting a survival lighter. Your lighter should be lightweight, compact, and easy to carry around. Opt for lighters with a small profile and a sturdy clip that allows you to attach it to your backpack, belt, or keychain. Some models come with an integrated clip while others require a separate accessory.

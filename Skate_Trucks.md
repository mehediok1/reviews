## Buyer's Guide

Welcome to our comprehensive guide on skate trucks. Skate trucks, also known as axles, are an essential component of a skateboard that allow the wheels to pivot and move freely. In this guide, we will cover the key factors you need to consider when choosing skate trucks, as well as some general advice to ensure you make the best purchase for your needs. 


### Type of Skate Trucks

Skate trucks come in three main types: standard, reverse kingpin, and independent. Each type has its unique characteristics and features that cater to different riding styles and preferences. Standard trucks are the most common and suitable for professional skateboarders, while reverse kingpin trucks offer increased stability and are ideal for beginners or cruising. 


### Components and Materials

When purchasing skate trucks, consider the materials used in their construction. High-quality trucks are usually made from aluminum or steel, which provide durability and strength. Look for trucks with titanium or magnesium components, as they are lightweight yet strong, enhancing the overall skateboard's performance. Additionally, inspect the baseplate, kingpin, and hanger for any welds or gaps that may affect the skateboard's performance. 


### Bushing Types

Skate trucks use bushes to connect the kingpin and hanger. There are several types of bushes available, each offering different levels of responsiveness and control. Softer bushing types provide a smoother feel and increased flexibility, whereas harder bushes offer more precision and stability. Consider your preferred riding style and compatibility with other skateboard components when selecting bushing types. 


### Skate Truck Adjustment and Maintenance

Adjustable trucks allow you to fine-tune the skateboard's responsiveness and stability. Look for trucks with adjustable pivot and kingpin lengths, as they provide greater flexibility in tuning the skateboard's performance. Regular maintenance is essential to ensure the trucks function optimally. Clean and lubricate the trucks after each skating session, and replace any worn components, such as bushes or washers, to maintain their performance. 


## FAQ


### What are skate trucks?

Skate trucks are a crucial component of a skateboard. They connect the wheels to the board and provide a smooth and stable ride. Skate trucks are designed to be adjustable, allowing skaters to set their board's trucks at a preferred angle to suit their riding style and preferences. The basic construction of skate trucks consists of a baseplate, hanger, kingpin, and pivot. 

Skate trucks are made of various materials, such as aluminum or steel, which are durable and lightweight. They come in different types, styles, and colors, with each brand offering unique features and performance characteristics. The choice of skate trucks depends on factors like the skater's skill level, riding style, and preference for a specific brand or model. 


### What are the different types of skate trucks?

There are two main types of skate trucks: top-mount and bottom-mount. Top-mount trucks have the baseplate mounted at the top of the skateboard's deck, while bottom-mount trucks have the baseplate mounted at the bottom. Top-mount trucks generally offer a more responsive and poppy ride, while bottom-mount trucks provide a more stable and consistent performance. 

There are also different types of axle trucks, which include traditional, drop-through, and reverse kingpin trucks. Traditional trucks are the most common type, while drop-through trucks have a lower deck profile and offer a smoother ride. Reverse kingpin trucks have a unique pivot design that provides stability and control. 


### What are the key features to look for in skate trucks?

When selecting skate trucks, there are a few key features to consider. The first is the type of baseplate - top-mount or bottom-mount. The second is the axle design - traditional, drop-through, or reverse kingpin. Other important factors include the truck's weight, durability, and adjustability. Many skate trucks also come with different bushings and pivot cups, which allow the skater to fine-tune the ride for their preferred feel and responsiveness. 

Brand reputation is another important consideration, as some brands are known for their quality, performance, and customer support. It's essential to choose skate trucks that match your riding style, preferences, and budget to get the best possible experience and longevity from your skateboard setup. 


### How do I install skate trucks on my skateboard?

Installing skate trucks on a skateboard is a relatively straightforward process that typically involves the following steps: unscrewing the old trucks from the board, drilling new holes in theboard if necessary, and screwing the new trucks into place. However, it's crucial to note that not all skateboard sets are the same, and the specific steps involved may vary depending on the deck and trucks being installed. 

It's recommended to consult the skateboard or truck manufacturer's instructions for detailed guidance or seek assistance from a knowledgeable skate shop if unfamiliar with the process. Additionally, ensure that the board and trucks are compatible and that the screws are tightened securely to prevent any loose or wobbly trucks. 


### What are some common issues with skate trucks?

Some common issues that skateboarders may encounter with skate trucks include loose or wobbly trucks, damaged bushings or pivot cups, worn-out bearings, and metal fatigue or corrosion. Loose trucks can be addressed by tightening the screws, while damaged bushings, pivot cups, and bearings may require replacement. 

Metal fatigue or corrosion can occur over time, particularly in areas with high humidity or exposure to saltwater. Regular maintenance and care, such as lubrication and proper storage, can help prolong the lifespan of skate truck components. If a truck becomes severely damaged or worn, it may be necessary to replace the entire unit or its individual components for optimal performance and safety. 


### How much do skate trucks typically cost?

The cost of skate trucks varies depending on the brand, type, and materials used. Entry-level skate trucks can typically be found for around $20 to $30, while more advanced or high-performance trucks can cost up to $150 or more. It's essential to consider factors like brand reputation, performance characteristics, and materials used when choosing skate trucks, as these attributes can impact the overall quality and longevity of the product. 

Considering that skate trucks are generally a long-lasting and durable item, investing in a higher-quality, more expensive set can be a worthwhile investment for serious skateboarders looking to optimize their performance and enjoyment on the board. However, it's also possible to find affordable options that offer good value for money without compromising on essential features like durability and adjustability.

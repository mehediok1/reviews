Proper cleaning is important to prevent dirt and debris buildup, which can damage the machine or cause performance issues. Oil lubrication ensures smooth operation and prevents the buildup of friction, while regular checking and replacing of worn parts guarantees optimal performance. Additionally, aligning the needle and thread correctly is crucial to prevent thread breakage and damage to the fabric. Regular maintenance not only guarantees optimal performance but also helps to prevent costly repairs or replacements down the line.

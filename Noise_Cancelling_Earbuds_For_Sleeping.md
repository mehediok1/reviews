## Buyer's Guide

If you're looking for the perfect noise cancelling earbuds to help you sleep better, there are several factors to consider. In this buyer's guide, we'll discuss some key features and considerations to look out for when choosing the best noise cancelling earbuds for sleeping. 


### Comfort And Design

Since you'll be wearing the earbuds for an extended period, it's essential that they're comfortable and well-designed. Look for earbuds with a small, lightweight design that won't cause discomfort or irritation during sleep. Additionally, check if the earbuds come with different ear tips or wings to help secure them in place. Many sleep earbuds also have a gentle, cushioned fit to prevent pressure points. 


### Noise Cancellation Quality

The primary goal of noise cancelling earbuds for sleeping is to block out noise effectively. Look for earbuds with advanced active noise cancellation technology that can reduce ambient sounds, such as snoring, traffic, or loud neighbors. Some earbuds also offer passive noise cancellation through the use of premium materials and ergonomic design. Test the noise cancellation performance by listening to a range of sounds, including white noise or soothing music. 


### Battery Life And Portability

Noise cancelling earbuds for sleeping should have a long battery life, so the earbuds don't have to be recharged frequently. Consider earbuds with at least 8 hours of battery life on a single charge, and be sure to check the brand's claims for battery performance under real-world conditions. It's also helpful if the earbuds come with a portable case or a charging cord for on-the-go usage. 


### Built-In Sleep Timers And Additional Features

Some sleep earbuds come with built-in sleep timers to help you drift off more easily. Setting a sleep timer means the earbuds will automatically shut off after a predetermined time, preventing them from being left on unnecessarily. Additional features to look for include Bluetooth connectivity, compatibility with smartphone apps, and the ability to stream music or sleep sounds directly from the earbuds. 


## FAQ

Make sure to choose earbuds specifically marketed for sleeping to ensure they meet your needs. 

Additionally, it's essential to test out the earbuds before committing to them.

## Buyer's Guide

When you're running a business that relies heavily on foot traffic, having a prominent "We Are Open" sign can be incredibly beneficial. Not only does it attract customers, but it also signals to passersby that your establishment is currently open for business. However, not all open signs are created equal. In this buyer's guide, we'll discuss the general features to consider when purchasing a We Are Open sign, some important things to think about before making a purchase, and some general advice to ensure you get the best product for your business. 


### Features to Consider

When shopping for a We Are Open sign, there are several important features you should consider to ensure the product you choose meets your specific needs. Some of these features include the sign's material, size, lighting, and design. By taking the time to research and compare these features, you'll be well-equipped to make the best purchase for your business. 


### Size

The size of your We Are Open sign will depend on the size of your storefront and how far away it needs to be easily read by potential customers. A sign with a large font size and eye-catching design will be more effective in attracting attention from a distance. Smaller signs, on the other hand, may be more suitable for smaller businesses or those with a more subtle design approach. 


### Lighting

If you're open during hours when it gets dark, then a We Are Open sign with some form of lighting is essential. LED lights are a good choice because they are energy-efficient, long-lasting, and visually appealing. Consider purchasing a sign with built-in lights or a separate light fixture that can be easily installed, depending on your specific needs and preferences. 


### Design

To make the most impact with your We Are Open sign, it's essential that it has a compelling design. A bright, bold font is best for capturing attention, and a sign with a visually appealing color combination will also help to set it apart from other signs. Some signs even come with customizable, changeable graphics that can be updated with different messages depending on the time of year or your business's current promotions.

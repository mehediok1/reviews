## Buyer's Guide

Looking for that classic, sweet treat? Red licorice candy is a timeless favorite. While there are countless brands and flavors, understanding the essential features and considerations for red licorice can help you make a well-informed purchase. Here, we present our guide to choosing the perfect red licorice candy. 


### Features to Consider

When shopping for red licorice, here are the key features you'll want to consider to ensure you get the best possible taste and value for your money: 
1. Ingredient List: Check the label to make sure the product contains natural flavors and colors, rather than artificial alternatives. 2. Texture: Some red licorice candies have a chewy, fibrous texture; others may be softer and more pliable. Consider your personal preference when making a selection. 3. Packaging: If you plan to share your red licorice or want to use it for snacks or parties, choose a brand with individual pieces or recloseable bags. Larger packages may be more cost-effective, but also more difficult to portion. 4. Flavor Options: Red licorice comes in a variety of flavors, including anise, butterscotch, and even cinnamon. If you have a preference, look for a brand that offers a range of flavors. 


### Quality Matters

When choosing red licorice candy, quality should be a top priority. Look for a brand that uses high-quality ingredients, has a consistent texture, and is widely reviewed for its taste. While it may cost a bit more, you'll be able to enjoy a better-quality product that will last longer and be more enjoyable to share with friends and family. 


### Health Concerns and Allergies

While red licorice is a popular and beloved treat, it's essential to consider any health concerns or allergies you may have. Many red licorice candies are made with wheat-based products, which may pose a risk for those with gluten intolerance or Celiac disease. Be sure to check the packaging for a "gluten-free" or "wheat-free" label. Additionally, if you have known allergies to certain ingredients, always read the label carefully before making a purchase. 


### Storage and Shelf Life

When purchasing red licorice candy, consider how you plan to store and use the product. Many brands recommend storing the candy in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight. If you plan on consuming all of the candy within a short period, this may not be a significant concern. However, if you're looking for something with a longer shelf life or want to share with friends, be sure to choose a brand with clear storage guidelines and a product that is designed to last. 


## FAQ


### What is red licorice candy?

Red licorice candy is a sweet, chewy, and fruity confection made primarily from licorice root, corn syrup, and various fruit or spice flavors. It is typically available in bright red, long rope-like strands that are twisted, braided, or twisted into unique shapes such as licorice sticks, balls, or even gummies. 

Red licorice candy became popular in the 19th century, thanks to its long-lasting texture and vibrant color. It is often associated with nostalgia and is a popular choice during Halloween, Valentine's Day, and other celebrations where candy is commonly exchanged or enjoyed. Today, it is produced by various manufacturers and sold in different packaging styles and flavors. 


### Is red licorice candy different from black licorice?

Yes, red licorice candy is distinctly different from black licorice. Red licorice is made primarily from anise or licorice root, while black licorice is made from star anise or sweet fermented licorice. The flavor of red licorice is sweet and fruity, while black licorice has a strong, bitter, and unique taste. Additionally, black licorice contains higher levels of glycyrrhizin, a compound that can interact with certain medical conditions or medications, leading to potential serious side effects. 

Red licorice is generally safer to consume, with fewer health concerns, and it is more popular due to its appealing flavor and appearance. Both red and black licorice candies are available in a variety of shapes and styles, catering to different preferences and taste buds. They can be found in supermarkets, convenience stores, and online retailers worldwide. 


### What are some popular brands of red licorice candy?

There are several brands that produce red licorice candy. Some of the more well-known brands include Red Vines, Twizzlers, and Fiddle Faddle. These brands have been around for decades and are trusted by consumers for their high-quality products and consistent flavors. They can be found in various supermarkets, convenience stores, and specialty candy shops across the United States. 

Other popular red licorice brands include Brach's, Trolli, and Haribo. These brands offer a diverse range of products, including gummy bears, licorice sticks, and licorice rope in various fruit flavors such as cherry, strawberry, and grape. These brands are also available at various retail outlets, both online and offline, making it convenient for consumers to find and purchase their favorite red licorice candy. 


### What makes red licorice candy so vibrant in color?

The vibrant red color of red licorice candy comes from the addition of a food coloring agent called Red 40. Red Licorice, especially the hard candy variety, has a bright red color due to the presence of this food coloring. However, not all red licorice is made with Red 40. Some brands may use natural colorants such as annatto or beet juice to achieve the red color. Despite the food dye, red licorice is generally considered safe for consumption, with the FDA setting a safe level for the use of Red 40 in candy. 

It is also important to note that, while the vibrant red color of red licorice is visually appealing, its taste is primarily determined by the flavorings and the type of licorice root or anise oil used. The use of food coloring alone does not significantly alter the taste of red licorice candy, making it an enjoyable treat regardless of whether it contains synthetic dyes or natural colorants. 


### Are there any health benefits associated with eating red licorice candy?

Red licorice candy, especially those made from licorice root, may have some health benefits associated with its consumption. Licorice root contains a compound called glycyrrhizin, which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Some studies have suggested that glycyrrhizin may help soothe sore throat and relieve coughs, potentially due to its antimicrobial properties. 

However, it is essential to consume red licorice candy in moderation. Like any sugary candy, excessive consumption of red licorice can lead to tooth decay and contribute to obesity, especially if consumed alongside sedentary behavior. It is also important to note that not all red licorice candy contains licorice root, and the health benefits associated with glycyrrhizin may be significantly diminished or even absent when the candy is made from anise or other sources. As with any sweet treat, it is crucial to maintain a balanced diet and practice good oral hygiene habits to protect one's health. 


### Can I make red licorice candy at home?

Yes, it is possible to make red licorice candy at home. There are various recipes available online and in cookbooks that use ingredients such as licorice root, corn syrup, sugar, and fruit or spice extracts to create a homemade version of the popular candy. Some recipes even use natural colorants like beet juice or annatto to achieve the desired bright red hue. 

While making red licorice candy at home can be a fun and rewarding activity, it does require some preparation, time, and effort. It is essential to follow the recipe precisely and be aware of the cooking process to achieve a consistent texture and flavor. Additionally, it is crucial to sanitize your kitchen tools and surfaces to prevent contamination and ensure the safety of the homemade candy.

## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to travel or keeping your dog safe and secure, soft sided dog crates are a popular choice. Made from durable materials such as polyester or nylon, these crates are lightweight, comfortable, and versatile. In this buyer's guide, we will discuss important features, considerations, and general advice for selecting the right soft sided dog crate for your needs. We will also outline the different types of soft sided crates available, their benefits, and how to properly use and maintain them. 


### Size and Dimensions

The size of the soft sided dog crate is crucial in ensuring your dog's comfort and safety. When choosing a crate, consider your dog's current size, as well as its growth and movement patterns. A good rule of thumb is to allow around 2-3 inches of additional room for your dog to be able to stand up, turn around, and lay down comfortably. Soft sided dog crates come in various sizes, so always measure your dog's dimensions before making a purchase. 


### Material and Durability

Soft sided dog crates are made from materials such as polyester, nylon, or a blend of both. These materials are lightweight and easy to clean, but they may require you to be mindful of chewing or clawing. Look for crates with reinforced stitching and strong zippers to ensure durability. Some manufacturers also provide a warranty with their products, which can offer peace of mind when investing in a soft sided dog crate. 


### Style and Features

There are different styles and features available for soft sided dog crates. Some common styles include a single door, double door, or top loading. Single door crates often have a zippered door, which makes them easy to collapse when not in use. Double door and top loading crates provide more accessibility for your dog and allow for easier loading and unloading. 


### Easy to Set Up and Transport

One of the main advantages of soft sided dog crates is their ease of set up and transportation. Most crates come with a carrying handle or an adjustable shoulder strap. When traveling or taking your dog on trips, having a lightweight and portable crate is essential. Be sure to choose a soft sided dog crate that comes with all the necessary accessories, such as a carrying case or storage pocket for food and water bowls. 


## FAQ


### What are the benefits of a soft-sided dog crate?

A soft-sided dog crate offers several advantages over traditional hard-shell dog crates. Firstly, it is usually more lightweight and portable, making it easier to move around or take on the go. Secondly, the soft materials can provide comfort and familiarity for your dog, preventing stress or anxiety. Lastly, they often come with more color and design options, allowing you to match the crate to your dog's personality or your home decor. 

However, their flexibility also means they are not as sturdy or secure as hard-shell crates, especially when it comes to preventing escape or protecting your dog from external hazards. It's essential to choose the right soft-sided crate for your dog's needs and consider factors such as durability, escape-proofing, and ventilation. 


### How do I choose the right size soft-sided dog crate?

To choose the right size soft-sided dog crate, measure the length, width, and height of your dog from the top of their head to the floor. Add about 2-3 inches to each dimension to account for the crate's collapsible nature. This will give you an approximate size range for your dog. Many soft-sided crates are designed to fit specific dog breeds or sizes, so you may want to choose a crate specifically tailored to your dog's needs. 

Consider the activities your dog will be engaging in while in the crate, such as sleeping, resting, or occasional travel. Make sure the crate is large enough for your dog to stand up, turn around, and lie down comfortably, but not too large that your dog can move around excessively and cause accidents. 


### What accessories are available for soft-sided dog crates?

Accessories can enhance the comfort and functionality of soft-sided dog crates. Some common accessories include travel bags, which allow you to carry your crate comfortably on the go; crate covers, which protect the crate and keep it clean during transport; and ventilation panels, which provide additional airflow to the crate and can be particularly useful during hot weather. 

Additional padding, such as memory foam or interchangeable crate pads, can be added to the bottom or sides of the crate for added comfort. Some crates also come with a carrying handle, making them more convenient to transport. Lastly, consider purchasing a crate divider if your dog is small or you need to create separate sleeping spaces for multiple dogs in the same crate. 


### Are soft-sided dog crates suitable for training?

Soft-sided dog crates can be suitable for training, depending on the specific crate and your dog's needs. While they may not be as escape-proof as hard-shell crates, using a soft-sided crate for training purposes requires some additional considerations. Make sure the crate is sturdy and well-constructed, with a secure bottom or base to prevent your dog from breaking out or chewing through the material. 

Consistent use of a soft-sided crate for potty training or training your dog to stay in one spot can help establish boundaries and encourage good behavior. Be sure to supervise your dog while they are in the crate and gradually increase the duration of their confinement to prevent stress or anxiety. 


### What are the pros and cons of soft-sided dog crates?

Soft-sided dog crates have several advantages and disadvantages, making them suitable for some dogs and situations, but not others. Some pros include their portability, lightweight nature, and typically lower cost compared to hard-shell crates. Additionally, the soft materials offer comfort and familiarity to your dog, which can reduce stress or anxiety during transport or travel. 

However, there are also some cons to consider. Soft-sided crates are generally less sturdy or escape-proof than hard-shell crates, which can be a concern for pet owners who want to ensure their dog cannot chew through the material or break out of the crate. Additionally, they may not be as durable or long-lasting as hard-shell crates. It's essential to choose a soft-sided crate that is well-constructed and designed to meet your dog's specific needs. 


### How long should my dog stay in a soft-sided dog crate?

The duration your dog should spend in a soft-sided dog crate depends on their age, temperament, and the specific crate model. For puppies, it's essential to monitor their crate time regularly and gradually increase it to prevent stress or anxiety. It's recommended that your puppy should not spend more than 2-3 hours at a time in the crate, with frequent potty breaks to minimize the risk of accidents or bladder problems. 

For adult dogs, the crate time should be slightly longer, usually up to 4-5 hours at a time. However, it's important to consider your dog's needs and provide them with regular exercise, potty breaks, and socialization to prevent boredom or anxiety. Gradually increasing the crate time can help your dog become more comfortable and confident in the crate, ultimately leading to a positive experience for both you and your dog.

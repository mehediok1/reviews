## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to finding the perfect chew necklace for kids, there are various factors to consider. These wearable devices can help reduce fussiness during meals, calm down a child, and provide sensory stimulation. Let's explore the essential features and considerations when purchasing a chew necklace for your little ones. 


### Material

The material used to make a chew necklace is crucial. You want to choose one that is safe, durable, and comfortable for your child to wear. Look for necklaces made from food-grade silicone, as it is safe for teething babies and toddlers. Silicone is also hypoallergenic and easy to clean, making it a great choice for kids with sensitive skin or allergies. 


### Size and Weight

Another important factor to consider when buying a chew necklace for kids is the size and weight of the item. The size should be appropriate for your child's age and neck size, while the weight should be light enough for them to wear comfortably throughout the day. It's essential to select a necklace that is neither too heavy nor too small, as this could lead to discomfort or even injury. 


### Design and Versatility

Think about the design and versatility of the chew necklace when making your purchase. Look for a necklace with a variety of textures and colors, which can help stimulate your child's senses and keep them engaged. Also, consider a necklace that can be worn as a bracelet or anklet, providing more options for your child to explore their sensory world. 


### Durability and Maintenance

Finally, consider the durability and maintenance requirements of the chew necklace. Choose one that can withstand daily wear and tear without breaking or losing its shape. The chew necklace should also be easy to clean, as it will likely be exposed to various fluids and particles throughout the day. 


## FAQ


### What is a chew necklace for kids?

A chew necklace for kids is a wearable and portable solution designed to help children with oral sensory needs or those who have a tendency to chew on non-food items. Made of safe, non-toxic materials, these necklaces provide a soothing sensory experience for kids while helping to prevent accidents caused by chewing on unsafe objects. 

Chew necklaces for kids usually come in multiple colors and designs, making them appealing to both parents and children. These necklaces can be worn during playtime, at school, or when the child needs to focus on a task to help reduce anxiety and promote relaxation. They also serve as a helpful tool for parents who wish to redirect children's oral fixing behavior to a more appropriate and safe alternative. 


### Who can benefit from chew necklaces for kids?

Chew necklaces for kids can benefit a wide range of children, including those with sensory processing, autism, ADHD, oral fixation, or a history of anxiety or OCD. They can also be helpful for typically developing children who tend to chew on non-food items or engage in oral stimming behaviors without realizing the potential hazards. 

Even children who might not have any of these issues can still benefit from chew necklaces as an alternative to their fingers, toys, or other items at playtime. By providing a safe and comfortable way to stimulate the mouth, chew necklaces can help kids remain focused on their activities while also providing a sensory prop for self-regulation. 


### What materials are chew necklaces made from?

Chew necklaces for kids are often made from non-toxic, food-grade silicone or other safe materials designed to be chewed on without causing harm. Silicone is soft, flexible, and highly durable, making it an excellent choice for necklaces as it can withstand the wear and tear of constant chewing without breaking down. 

Some chew necklaces may also incorporate safety features like double-knotted clasps or break-away designs to prevent the necklace from becoming detached during use and posing a choking hazard. Additionally, parents can choose from various textures to provide an even more stimulating sensory experience for their children. 


### What are the benefits of using a chew necklace for kids?

There are several benefits to using a chew necklace for kids, including sensory stimulation, anxiety reduction, and improved focus. By providing children with a safe and non-toxic object to chew on, chew necklaces can help them regulate their oral stimming behaviors and reduce anxiety or stress levels. 

Furthermore, having something comforting to chew on can create a calming effect for kids, enabling them to concentrate better on tasks and activities. Chew necklaces can be especially helpful during transition times, when the child needs to settle down, or when boredom sets in. Overall, chew necklaces can be a valuable tool for parents and educators looking for a safe and effective way to support children's sensory and emotional well-being. 


### Do chew necklaces prevent kids from chewing on other objects?

While chew necklaces provide a safe alternative to help redirect children's chewing behavior away from non-food items, they alone are not a guaranteed way to prevent kids from chewing on other objects. It is essential to educate children on the potential risks of chewing on unsafe materials and to supervise them closely to ensure their safety. 

Parents and caregivers should also address the underlying reasons for the child's need to chew and provide a range of options to help alleviate their oral stimming behaviors. This may include having a variety of safe chewing devices available, practicing deep breathing or relaxation techniques, and engaging in activities that stimulate the senses in other ways. By taking a multi-faceted approach, children can be encouraged to develop healthier chewing habits and improve their overall well-being. 


### How do I choose the right chew necklace for my child?

When choosing a chew necklace for your child, it is essential to consider factors such as their age, chewing intensity, and preference in colors and textures. Younger children typically require softer materials, while older kids can handle more durable options. It is also important to consider the necklace's design and size, ensuring that it is comfortable and secure for your child to wear. 

Additionally, parents and caregivers should be aware of the necklace's safety features, such as a double-knotted clasp or break-away design, to minimize the risk of injury. By considering these factors, you can choose a chew necklace that best suits your child's needs and preferences, helping to make the experience more enjoyable and beneficial. It is also recommended to read reviews and consult with a professional if you have any concerns or questions.

## FAQ


### What is Glossy Cardstock?

Glossy cardstock is a type of paper that has a shiny, reflective surface. It is typically used for cards, invitations, brochures, and other paper-based marketing materials where an eye-catching and professional appearance is desired. The glossy finish enhances the overall quality and durability of the paper, making it a popular choice for many designers and businesses. 

Glossy cardstock is available in various weights, styles, and finishes, so customers can choose the one that best suits their specific needs and budget. Some common weights for glossy cardstock include 200gsm, 250gsm, and 300gsm. It is essential to consider the weight and finish when selecting glossy cardstock for a project to ensure a satisfactory result. 


### What are the benefits of using Glossy Cardstock?

There are several advantages to using glossy cardstock for paper products. One of the primary benefits is that it creates a high-quality, professional appearance. The shiny surface enhances the colors and graphics printed on the paper, making them more vivid and eye-catching. This is particularly important for designs that rely heavily on visual elements to convey their message. 

Glossy cardstock is also durable and resistant to wear and tear. It is less likely to show fingerprints or scratches compared to matte or other finishes, and the glossy surface can help protect the paper from damage. As a result, glossy cardstock is an excellent choice for products that need to be handled frequently or have a longer shelf life. 


### What are the most common uses for Glossy Cardstock?

The most popular uses for glossy cardstock include business cards, wedding invitations, holiday cards, and other personal and professional greeting cards. The shiny surface adds an elegant touch to these products, making them stand out and look more luxurious. Glossy cardstock is also commonly used for marketing materials such as brochures, flyers, and promotional items, as it can convey professionalism and sophistication. 

Other uses for glossy cardstock include packaging for cosmetics, gift bags, greeting card inserts, and high-quality printing samples. Essentially, glossy cardstock is a versatile choice that can be used for various applications where an eye-catching and professional appearance is essential. Therefore, it is an excellent choice for businesses and designers looking to make a statement with their paper products. 


### What is the difference between Glossy and Matte Cardstock?

The main difference between glossy and matte cardstock lies in their surface finish. As the name suggests, glossy cardstock has a shiny, reflective surface, while matte cardstock has a non-reflective, flat surface. The glossy finish enhances colors and graphics, making them more vivid and eye-catching, while the matte finish creates a more subdued and natural appearance. 

However, there are benefits to using both finishes. Glossy cardstock is generally more durable and resistant to wear and tear, as it is less likely to show fingerprints or scratches compared to matte cardstock. Matte cardstock, on the other hand, might be a better choice for designs that require a softer, more subtle appearance, and it tends to be more budget-friendly. 


### Can I use Glossy Cardstock for double-sided printing?

Yes, you can use glossy cardstock for double-sided printing. The shiny surface of glossy cardstock might slightly interfere with the bonding process when using adhesive-backed papers, but this issue can typically be overcome with suitable double-sided tape or glue. When printing on both sides of glossy cardstock, it is always a good idea to follow the printer's instructions and use a compatible adhesive to ensure the best results. 

It is worth mentioning that some printing methods may not be suitable for double-sided printing on glossy cardstock, so it is essential to check with your printer before attempting to print on both sides of this paper type. In general, offset printing, digital printing, and laser printing are all capable of printing on both sides of glossy cardstock effectively. 


### Is Glossy Cardstock available in different sizes and shapes?

Yes, glossy cardstock is available in various sizes and shapes to suit the needs of different projects. Popular standard sizes include 8&timesx 8 inches, 4&timesx 6 inches, 5&timesx 7 inches, and 6&timesx 4 inches. However, custom sizes and shapes are also possible, depending on the specific requirements of a project. Some common shapes for glossy cardstock include rectangular, square, circular, and custom-cut shapes. To ensure the best results, it is essential to choose a cardstock size and shape that is suitable for the intended print application. 

Several factors can influence the available sizes and shapes of glossy cardstock, such as the manufacturing process, the intended usage, and the target market. Generally, it is best to consult with a paper supplier or printing expert to determine the available size and shape options for glossy cardstock based on your specific project requirements.
